abstract = {The aims of this paper were to estimate the numbers of tuberculosis notifications in young white adults which will be prevented in the next 25 years by the schools BCG vaccination scheme, and to assess the numbers of additional notifications if the scheme were to be discontinued. Assuming that in the white ethnic group in England and Wales the decline in tuberculosis notification rates (8-10{\%} per year for ages less than 45 years) and efficacy of BCG vaccination (75-80{\%}) are maintained, it is estimated that the scheme for BCG vaccination of schoolchildren with its present coverage will prevent 217 notifications in those aged 15-29 years in 1993, 119 in 1998, and 69 in 2003. The epidemiological consequences of stopping the BCG in schools scheme, whenever this occurs, would be a substantial slowing of the rate of decline of tuberculosis notifications, confined almost entirely to the 15-29 years age group, for a period of about 15 years, after which the steeper decline would resume. If the scheme stopped at the end of 1991 the annual number of additional notifications would slowly increase to a maximum of just over 80 about 15 years later, and then decrease. For stopping at the end of 1996 the maximum annual number of additional notifications would be about 50.},

abstract = {The R package mice imputes incomplete multivariate data by chained equations. The software mice 1.0 appeared in the year 2000 as an S-PLUS library, and in 2001 as an R package. mice 1.0 introduced predictor selection, passive imputation and automatic pooling. This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) disease in Greenland doubled in the 1990s. To combat the increase, national TB interventions were initiated in 2000 and strengthened in 2007.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To determine whether the effect of interventions could be detected, we estimated the TB disease risk among children≤15 years before and after interventions were implemented.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: For a study cohort, we recruited all children ≤15 years of age included in the Greenlandic Civil Registration System (CRS) from 1990 to 2010. The CRS identifier was used to link cohort participants with TB cases identified based on the Greenlandic National TB registry. Bacille Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination status was identified through year of birth, as BCG was offered to newborns born either before 1991 or after 1996. Years with interventions were defined as 2000-2006 (primary interventions) and 2007-2010 (intensified interventions). Risk of TB was estimated using Poisson regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The study included 35,858 children, of whom 209 had TB disease. The TB disease incidence decreased after interventions were implemented (2007-2010: IRR [incidence rate ratios] 0.62, 95{\%} CI: 0.39-0.95, p=0.03, compared with the 1995-1999 period). The TB disease risk was inversely associated with BCG vaccination (IRR: 0.54, 95{\%} CI: 0.41-0.72, p{\textless}0.001).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Years with national TB interventions in Greenland, including neonate BCG vaccination, are associated with a lower TB disease incidence among children ≤15 years of age.},

Twenty-two patients had infection with atypical mycobacteria and were excluded from analysis, as were children under 16 years. Comparison between the age groups was further restricted to white patients because of a skew distribution of Asian patients towards the younger age range. Ninety-six elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) were compared with 127 younger patients. The distribution of pulmonary and extrathoracic disease was similar as was the incidence of positive bacteriology. Elderly people had more frequent lower-zone and more frequent miliary shadowing, otherwise radiographic features were similar. Elderly people were nearly three times more likely to have reactions to antituberculous drugs, six times more likely to die from tuberculosis and over twenty times more likely than younger patients to have the diagnosis made at autopsy rather than during life.},

@article{Sankoh2014,
abstract = {Most childhood interventions (vaccines, micronutrients) in low-income countries are justified by their assumed effect on child survival. However, usually the interventions have only been studied with respect to their disease/deficiency-specific effects and not for their overall effects on morbidity and mortality. In many situations, the population-based effects have been very different from the anticipated effects; for example, the measles-preventive high-titre measles vaccine was associated with 2-fold increased female mortality; BCG reduces neonatal mortality although children do not die of tuberculosis in the neonatal period; vitamin A may be associated with increased or reduced child mortality in different situations; effects of interventions may differ for boys and girls. The reasons for these and other contrasts between expectations and observations are likely to be that the immune system learns more than specific prevention from an intervention; such training may enhance or reduce susceptibility to unrelated infections. INDEPTH member centres have been in an ideal position to document such additional non-specific effects of interventions because they follow the total population long term. It is proposed that more INDEPTH member centres extend their routine data collection platform to better measure the use and effects of childhood interventions. In a longer perspective, INDEPTH may come to play a stronger role in defining health research issues of relevance to low-income countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the protective efficacy of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) against tuberculosis decreases with time since vaccination. DESIGN: A quantitative review of all 10 randomized trials of BCG against tuberculosis in purified protein derivative (PPD)-negative individuals, that presented data for discrete periods. For each trial, we derived log rate ratios for the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. We also compared efficacy in the first two years, and the first 10 years, to that in the rest of the trial. RESULTS: There was considerable heterogeneity between trials in the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. In seven efficacy decreased overtime, while in three it increased. Average annual change in efficacy was not related to overall efficacy. Efficacy also varied between trials in the first two years after vaccination, at more than two years after vaccination and in the first ten years after vaccination. However the variation in efficacy between trials more than 10 years after vaccination was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). We therefore calculated that the average efficacy more than 10 years after vaccination was 14{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval -9{\%} to 32{\%}). CONCLUSION: BCG protection can wane with time since vaccination. There is no good evidence that BCG provides protection more than 10 years after vaccination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) recurrence can be due to reinfection or relapse. The contribution of each to TB incidence and the factors associated with recurrence are not well known. Effectiveness of TB control programs is assessed in part by recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to establish the recurrence rate of TB in Barcelona, the associated risk factors and the role of reinfection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A population-based retrospective longitudinal study was performed in Barcelona, Spain. TB patients with positive culture results who completed treatment between Jan 1(st), 2003 and Dec 31(st), 2006 were followed-up until December 31st, 2009 by the TB Control Program. The incidence rate of recurrence was calculated per person-year of follow-up (py). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used for the survival analysis by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 1,823 TB cases identified, 971 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 13 (1.3{\%}) had recurrent TB. The recurrence rate was 341 cases per 100,000 py, 13 times higher than the TB incidence of the general population. Likelihood of TB recurrence at the 1st, 3rd and 5th year of follow-up was 0.1{\%}, 1.4{\%} and 1.6{\%}, respectively. Factors associated with recurrence were HIV infection (HR: 4.7, CI: 1.4-15.7), living in the inner city district (HR: 3.9, CI: 1.3-11.8) and history of TB treatment (HR: 5.2, CI: 1.7-16.2). Genotyping results of recurrent cases were available for 6 patients (3 reinfections and 3 relapses).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The rate of TB recurrence in Barcelona is low and most episodes occur within the first three years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence are co-infected with HIV, living in neighborhoods with high TB incidence or with a history of TB treatment. When available, genotyping results help determine whether the recurrence is due to reinfection or relapse.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Little is known about how long the BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis. We assessed the long-term vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Norwegian-born individuals. METHODS In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we studied Norwegian-born individuals aged 12-50 years who were tuberculin skin test (TST) negative and eligible for BCG vaccination as part of the last round of Norway's mandatory mass tuberculosis screening and BCG vaccination programme between 1962 and 1975. We excluded individuals who had tuberculosis before or in the year of screening and those with unknown TST and BCG status. We obtained TST and BCG information and linked it to the National Tuberculosis Register, population and housing censuses, and the population register for emigrations and deaths. We followed individuals up to their first tuberculosis episode, emigration, death, or Dec 31, 2011. We used Cox regressions to estimate VE against all tuberculosis and just pulmonary tuberculosis by time since vaccination, adjusted for age, time, county-level tuberculosis rates, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators. FINDINGS Median follow-up was 41 years (IQR 32-49) for 83 421 BCG-unvaccinated and 44 years (41-46) for 297 905 vaccinated individuals, with 260 tuberculosis episodes. Tuberculosis rates were 3{\textperiodcentered}3 per 100 000 person-years in unvaccinated and 1{\textperiodcentered}3 per 100 000 person-years in vaccinated individuals. The adjusted average VE during 40 year follow-up was 49{\%} (95{\%} CI 26-65), although after 20 years, the VE was not significant (up to 9 years VE [excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years] 61{\%} [95{\%} CI 24-80]; 10-19 years 58{\%} [27-76]; 20-29 years 38{\%} [-32 to 71]; 30-40 years 42{\%} [-24 to 73]). VE against pulmonary tuberculosis up to 9 years (excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years) was 67{\%} (95{\%} CI 27-85), 10-19 years was 63{\%} (32-80), 20-29 years was 50{\%} (-19 to 79), and 30-40 years was 40{\%} (-46 to 76).

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the protective efficacy of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) against tuberculosis decreases with time since vaccination. DESIGN: A quantitative review of all 10 randomized trials of BCG against tuberculosis in purified protein derivative (PPD)-negative individuals, that presented data for discrete periods. For each trial, we derived log rate ratios for the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. We also compared efficacy in the first two years, and the first 10 years, to that in the rest of the trial. RESULTS: There was considerable heterogeneity between trials in the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. In seven efficacy decreased overtime, while in three it increased. Average annual change in efficacy was not related to overall efficacy. Efficacy also varied between trials in the first two years after vaccination, at more than two years after vaccination and in the first ten years after vaccination. However the variation in efficacy between trials more than 10 years after vaccination was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). We therefore calculated that the average efficacy more than 10 years after vaccination was 14{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval -9{\%} to 32{\%}). CONCLUSION: BCG protection can wane with time since vaccination. There is no good evidence that BCG provides protection more than 10 years after vaccination.},

abstract = {Approximately 100 million newborn children receive Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) annually, because vaccination is consistently protective against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB. By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%}, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission-Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US{\$}1-10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10{\%} and 80{\%} with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US{\$}116 and US{\$}9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US{\$}52-{\$}4540. At 80{\%} efficacy, revaccination averted 17{\%} of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Observational studies have suggested that BCG may have nonspecific beneficial effects on survival. Low-birth-weight (LBW) children are not given BCG at birth in Guinea-Bissau; we conducted a randomized trial of BCG at birth (early BCG) vs delayed BCG. METHODS In the period 2004-2008 we recruited 2320 LBW children in Bissau. The children were visited at home at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. With a pretrial infant mortality of 250 per 1000, we hypothesized a 25{\%} reduction in infant mortality for LBW children. RESULTS Infant mortality was only 101 per 1000 during the trial. In the primary analysis, infant mortality was reduced insignificantly by 17{\%} (mortality rate ratio [MRR] = .83 [.63-1.08]). In secondary analyses, early BCG vaccine was safe with an MRR of .49 (.21-1.15) after 3 days and .55 (.34-.89) after 4 weeks. The reduction in neonatal mortality was mainly due to fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever. The impact of early BCG on infant mortality was marked for children weighing {\textless}1.5 kg (MRR = .43 [.21-.85]) who had lower coverage for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS Though early BCG did not reduce infant mortality significantly, it may have a beneficial effect in the neonatal period. This could be important for public health because BCG is often delayed in low-income countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We examined the potential sex-differential and non-specific effects of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles vaccine (MV) in a rural area of Senegal. METHODS The 4133 children born in the area between 1996 and 1999 were included in the study. Vaccinations were provided at three health centres. Vaccine information was collected through 3-monthly home visits. The survival analysis compared the effects of BCG and DTP according to the following sequence of vaccinations: BCG-first, BCG+DTP1-first, or DTP1-first. We compared DTP and MV between 9 and 24 months of age, as 9 months is the minimum age for MV. RESULTS At 12 months the vaccination coverage was 44{\%}, 46{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively, for BCG, DTP1 and MV. Most children received BCG+DTP1-first and this combination was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate ratio (MRR) of 0.69 (0.53-0.89) compared with unvaccinated children. There was no benefit for children receiving BCG-first or DTP1-first. The female-male MRR was 0.79 (0.64-0.96) among unvaccinated children, but was significantly inversed with 1.45 (1.00-2.10) for children receiving DTP vaccination (test of homogeneity, p=0.006). Children who had received DTP simultaneously with MV or DTP after MV had significantly higher mortality (MRR=2.59 [1.32-5.07]) compared with children having MV-only as their most recent vaccination. After 9 months, the female-male MRR was 0.61 (0.31-1.19) for measles-vaccinated children but remained 1.54 (1.03-2.31) for DTP-vaccinated children who had not received MV (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS The sequence of routine vaccinations is important for the overall impact on child survival and these vaccines are associated with sex-differential effects.},

Selective neonatal BCG vaccination is recommended for infants at risk of TB in the UK. Neonatal BCG is safe and effective, with an overall protective value of 75{\%}. This study aimed to assess BCG rates among at risk infants in Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan, South Wales in the year 2003.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A cohort of infants at risk for TB was identified from demographic data stored on a computerised maternity activity database. A manual search of immunisation records determined overall rates and the rates for infants belonging to various ethnic groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 5308 infants born in 2003, 514 (9.6{\%}) were at risk of TB; 423 (82.2{\%}) of these infants were referred postnatally for BCG vaccination and 391 received it. Twenty six of the 41 at risk white British infants missed having a BCG vaccination compared with 47 of 288 Asian infants and seven of 39 black African babies. The rate of BCG vaccination among white British infants was 36.5{\%} compared with 83.6{\%} for Asian infants from the Indian subcontinent (chi(2) = 7.25, p{\textless}0.01) and 82{\%} for black African infants (chi(2) = 4.48, p{\textless}0.05).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: The overall BCG rate among at risk infants in Cardiff was 76{\%} during the study period. The vaccination rate was poor among white British infants compared with other ethnic groups. Enhanced awareness of health professionals to recognise the need for vaccinating certain white children at risk of TB is essential to improve BCG coverage in an increasingly multiethnic population.},

abstract = {The protective effect of BCG against tuberculosis (TB) estimated in randomized controlled trials and observational studies ranges from negative to close to a 100{\%}. One of the many explanations offered for this is that different immunological mechanisms may be associated with protective effect against different forms and sites of disease. In this investigation, we recalculated vaccine protective effect separately for pulmonary disease and for meningeal/miliary disease in randomized controlled trials and case-control studies, tested for heterogeneity in site-specific estimates of protective effect and calculated a summary measure when appropriate. We found protective effect against pulmonary disease to be heterogeneous to a statistically significant degree, and thus we did not calculate a summary measure of protection. Protective effect against meningeal and miliary TB was higher than against pulmonary disease and, except for a single study with two cases only, appeared to be homogenous. Summary BCG protective effect against miliary or meningeal TB in randomized controlled trials was 86{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 65, 95) and in case-control studies 75{\%} (95{\%} CI: 61, 84). The fact that protective effect appeared to be homogeneous against meningitis and miliary TB but not against pulmonary disease may result from the fact that patients with meningitis are on average younger and thus less likely to have been exposed to atypical bacteria; to a waning of the protective effect of BCG; or from the diversity of mechanisms of pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, which can originate from reinfection, reactivation or primary progression.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) has re-emerged over the past two decades: in industrialized countries in association with immigration, and in Africa owing to the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Drug-resistant TB is a major threat worldwide. The variable and uncertain impact of TB control necessitates not only better tools (diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines), but also better insights into the natural history and epidemiology of TB. Molecular epidemiological studies over the last two decades have contributed to such insights by answering long-standing questions, such as the proportion of cases attributable to recent transmission, risk factors for recent transmission, the occurrence of multiple Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and the proportion of recurrent TB cases attributable to re-infection. M. tuberculosis lineages have been identified and shown to be associated with geographical origin. The Beijing genotype is strongly associated with multidrug resistance, and may have escaped from bacille Calmette–Gu erin-induced immunity. DNA fingerprinting has quantified the importance of institutional transmission and laboratory cross-contamination, and has helped to focus contact investigations. Questions to be answered in the near future with whole genome sequencing include identification of chains of transmission within clusters of patients, more precise quantification of mixed infection, and transmission probabilities and rates of progression from infection to disease of various M. tuberculosis lineages, as well as possible variations in vaccine efficacy by lineage. Perhaps most importantly, dynamics in the population structure of M. tuberculosis in response to control measures in high-prevalence areas should be better understood.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73{\%}. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective. However, the low number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated severe TB cases leads to broad confidence intervals on vaccine efficacy, highlighting the difficulty associated with decision-making in low-prevalence settings.},

We systematically searched published material for studies using DNA fingerprinting to provide data on the issue. Very few studies were designed for that particular research objective and/or report on a sufficient number of observations. Differences in methods - eg, case-definitions - seriously hamper comparisons between studies. The proportion of recurrences due to reinfection ranged between 0{\%} and 100{\%}; however, this figure cannot be a useful indicator since the two causes of recurrence - relapse and reinfection - are essentially independent. Only one study provides an estimate of the incidence of recurrence due to reinfection, indicating its importance for HIV-infected patients in an environment with an unusually high tuberculosis incidence. We argue that apart from extreme situations like this one the problem of recurrence of tuberculosis due to reinfection has few implications for tuberculosis-control programmes.},

In Greenland, BCG vaccination was introduced in 1955, but was temporarily discontinued (1991-1996) due to nationwide policy changes. The study aimed to use the transient stop in BCG vaccination to evaluate the effect of vaccination onMTI prevalence and TB incidence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: MTI study: A cross-sectional study (2012), comprising East Greenlanders born during 1982-2006, evaluated the effect of BCG vaccination on MTI prevalence; a positive interferon $\gamma$ release assay defined an MTI case. Associations were estimated using logistic regression. TB study: a cohort study covering the same birth cohorts with follow-up until 2012 evaluated the vaccine's effect on TB incidence. A personal identifier allowed for follow-up in the TB notification system. Associations were estimated using Cox regression.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: MTI study: Included 953 participants; 81{\%} were BCG-vaccinated; 29{\%} had MTI, 23{\%} among vaccinated and 57{\%} among non-vaccinated.

abstract = {AIMS: To determine whether tuberculosis is increasing in frequency and to explore the association between deprivation, ethnicity, and tuberculosis in the city of Leeds. METHODS: Descriptive epidemiology and ecological analysis of a register of children and young people (0-18 years) diagnosed with tuberculosis from 1982 to 1997 in Leeds Health Authority. RESULTS: A total of 107 children were identified, 61 through contact tracing, to give an age and sex standardised incidence rate of 3.9 per 100 000 per year. Rates decreased over the 16 year study period by an estimated 6.6{\%} per year. The disease was more common in girls (56{\%}) and most frequent in 5-9 year olds, with respiratory disease accounting for the largest proportion (82{\%}). Children of south Asian origin (35{\%}) had a crude incidence rate of 25.7 per 100 000 per year. The female:male ratios differed notably between south Asian (1.9:1) and non-south Asian children (1.02:1). For all subjects, univariate analyses showed significant positive associations between incidence and deprivation, population density, and ethnicity. There were no significant associations between deprivation, population density, and ethnicity and incidence of tuberculosis in south Asian children. For non-south Asian, mainly white children, only deprivation was significant. The proportion of non-south Asian children in the population was the overriding factor influencing incidence of tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis remains an uncommon disease in Leeds children. An unexpected finding was a relatively higher incidence in Asian girls compared to boys. Overall, ethnicity explains a high proportion of disease independently of deprivation and population density but for non-south Asian Leeds children the strongest risk factor is deprivation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the International Union Against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) published recommendations standardising the evaluation of tuberculosis treatment outcome in Europe. These guidelines fail to account for clinically appropriate alterations in the management of patients. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate tuberculosis treatment outcome in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by redefining the outcome criteria and investigate factors associated with unsuccessful treatment outcome 12 months after notification. METHODS: This was a prospective analysis of a cohort of patients diagnosed in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and reported to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system in 2001 and 2002. Proportions of success and failure were calculated based on a new set of criteria following discussion with clinicians treating tuberculosis cases. Logistic regression was used to study risk factors for unsuccessful treatment outcome. RESULTS: 13 048 cases were notified in the study period. Of the 2676 that were identified as new sputum smear positive pulmonary cases, 2209 (82.5{\%}) had treatment outcome data reported. Using the WHO/IUATLD criteria, 76.8{\%} were classified as successful. In contrast, applying the new criteria, the success rate was 87.5{\%}. This rate exceeds the 85{\%} success target set by the WHO. Risk factors for unsuccessful treatment outcome included male sex (OR 1.27; 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 1.49), being elderly (p trend {\textless} 0.001), having pulmonary tuberculosis (OR 1.28; 95{\%} CI 1.08 to 1.53) and having resistance to any antituberculosis drug (OR 1.90; 95{\%} CI 1.44 to 2.52). CONCLUSION: The proportion of tuberculosis cases with a successful treatment outcome exceeded the target of 85{\%} success rate based on the modified outcome categories. Although the tuberculosis treatment outcome criteria set by WHO/IUATLD appear to be clear, they mix measures of process and outcome. Further refinement may be necessary in low incidence high income countries, especially those with a high mortality among the elderly.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that the bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine may have a non-specific beneficial effect on childhood survival in areas with high mortality. We examined whether BCG-vaccinated children with a BCG scar or a positive tuberculin reaction had better survival than children without such reactions. As part of an ongoing two-dose measles vaccine trial for which children were recruited at 6 months of age, we examined 1813 children for BCG scar at 6 months of age and 813 BCG-vaccinated children were skin-tested for delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin, tetanus and diphtheria. We found that BCG-vaccinated children with a BCG scar had significantly lower mortality compared with BCG scar-negative children, the mortality ratio in the first 12 months of follow-up being 0.41 (0.25-0.67). BCG-vaccinated children with a positive tuberculin test had a mortality ratio of 0.45 (0.24-0.85) compared with tuberculin negative children. These results were unchanged by control for potential confounders or using different cut-off points for a tuberculin-positive response. Exclusion of dead children who had HIV antibodies did not modify the estimate (mortality rate (MR)=0.46 (0.23-0.94)). After censoring for tuberculosis (TB) exposure at home, the mortality ratios for having a scar and being tuberculin-positive were 0.46 (0.27-0.79) or 0.42 (0.21-0.84), respectively. Children positive to tetanus or diphtheria in the skin test had the same mortality as children not responding to these vaccine-related antigens. Thus, BCG scar and a positive tuberculin reaction were associated with better survival in early childhood in an area with high mortality. Since nothing similar was found for responders to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and the effect could not be explained by protection against tuberculosis, the effect of BCG vaccination could be due to non-specific immune-stimulation protecting against other infections. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological and clinical research but their potential to undermine the validity of research results has often been overlooked in the medical literature (1). This is partly because statistical methods that can tackle problems arising from missing data have, until recently, not been readily accessible to medical researchers. However, multiple imputationa relatively flexible, general purpose approach to dealing with missing datais now available in standard statistical software,(2,5) making it possible to handle missing data semiroutinely. Results based on this computationally intensive method are increasingly reported, but it needs to be applied carefully to avoid misleading conclusions. In this article, we review the reasons why missing data may lead to bias and loss of information in epidemiological and clinical research. We discuss the circumstances in which multiple imputation may help by reducing bias or increasing precision, as well as describing potential pitfalls in its application. Finally, we describe the recent use and reporting of analyses using multiple imputation in general medical journals, and suggest guidelines for the conduct and reporting of such analyses.},

abstract = {Adaptive features of innate immunity, recently described as "trained immunity," have been documented in plants, invertebrate animals, and mice, but not yet in humans. Here we show that bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccination in healthy volunteers led not only to a four- to sevenfold increase in the production of IFN-$\gamma$, but also to a twofold enhanced release of monocyte-derived cytokines, such as TNF and IL-1$\beta$, in response to unrelated bacterial and fungal pathogens. The enhanced function of circulating monocytes persisted for at least 3 mo after vaccination and was accompanied by increased expression of activation markers such as CD11b and Toll-like receptor 4. These training effects were induced through the NOD2 receptor and mediated by increased histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation. In experimental studies, BCG vaccination induced T- and B-lymphocyte-independent protection of severe combined immunodeficiency SCID mice from disseminated candidiasis (100{\%} survival in BCG-vaccinated mice vs. 30{\%} in control mice). In conclusion, BCG induces trained immunity and nonspecific protection from infections through epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells.},

@article{Barnard1999,
abstract = {An appealing feature of multiple imputation is the simplicity of the rules for combining the multiple complete-data inferences into a final inference, the repeated-imputation inference (Rubin, 1987). This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees of freedom, $\nu$com, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m, is finite. When $\nu$com is small and there is only a modest proportion of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom, $\nu$m, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than $\nu$com, which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm, we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, $\nu$̃m, with the following three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information, $\nu$̃m monotonically increases in $\nu$com; $\nu$̃m is always less than or equal to $\nu$com; and $\nu$̃m equals $\nu$m when $\nu$com is infinite. A small simulation study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using $\nu$̃m rather than $\nu$m.},

@article{Gandhi2010,
abstract = {Although progress has been made to reduce global incidence of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis during the past decade threatens to undermine these advances. However, countries are responding far too slowly. Of the estimated 440 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis that occurred in 2008, only 7{\%} were identified and reported to WHO. Of these cases, only a fifth were treated according to WHO standards. Although treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is possible with currently available diagnostic techniques and drugs, the treatment course is substantially more costly and laborious than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Nonetheless, a few countries provide examples of how existing technologies can be used to reverse the epidemic of MDR tuberculosis within a decade. Major improvements in laboratory capacity, infection control, performance of tuberculosis control programmes, and treatment regimens for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease will be needed, together with a massive scale-up in diagnosis and treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis to prevent drug-resistant strains from becoming the dominant form of tuberculosis. New diagnostic tests and drugs are likely to become available during the next few years and should accelerate control of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Equally important, especially in the highest-burden countries of India, China, and Russia, will be a commitment to tuberculosis control including improvements in national policies and health systems that remove financial barriers to treatment, encourage rational drug use, and create the infrastructure necessary to manage MDR tuberculosis on a national scale. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Background: BCG vaccine has shown consistently high efficacy against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis, but variable efficacy against adult pulmonary tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases. We assess and compare the costs and effects of BCG as an intervention against severe childhood tuberculosis in different regions of the world. Methods: We calculated the number of tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis cases that have been and will be prevented in all children born in 2002, by combining estimates of the annual risk of tuberculosis infection, the proportion of infections that lead to either of these diseases in unvaccinated children, the number of children vaccinated, and BCG efficacy. Findings: We estimated that the 100??5 million BCG vaccinations given to infants in 2002 will have prevented 29 729 cases of tuberculous meningitis (5th-95th centiles, 24 063-36 192) in children during their first 5 years of life, or one case for every 3435 vaccinations (2771-4177), and 11 486 cases of miliary tuberculosis (7304-16 280), or one case for every 9314 vaccinations (6172-13 729). The numbers of cases prevented would be highest in South East Asia (46{\%}), sub-Saharan Africa (27{\%}), the western Pacific region (15{\%}), and where the risk of tuberculosis infection and vaccine coverage are also highest. At US{\$}2-3 per dose, BCG vaccination costs US{\$}206 (150-272) per year of healthy life gained. Interpretation: BCG vaccination is a highly cost-effective intervention against severe childhood tuberculosis; it should be retained in high-incidence countries as a strategy to supplement the chemotherapy of active tuberculosis. ?? 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent trends in demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome of treatment in paediatric cases of tuberculosis. DESIGN: National surveillance study. SETTING: England and Wales. PATIENTS: All children under the age of 16 years reported with tuberculosis to the national enhanced surveillance system between 1999 and 2006 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions, and rates of disease, by demographic characteristics, site of disease, diagnostic delay, culture confirmation, species, drug susceptibility and treatment outcome. RESULTS: 3563 cases of tuberculosis in children were reported between 1999 and 2006. The incidence rate remained stable at around 4.3 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI 4.1 to 4.4). Patients born outside the UK had a tuberculosis rate higher than children born in the UK (37 per 100,000 vs 2.5 per 100,000) and this rate increased over the period. Rates in the black African ethnic group were highest at 88 per 100,000. 60{\%} of children had pulmonary disease, the commonest presentation, but only 948 (27{\%}) had culture confirmed tuberculosis. The median time to diagnosis from onset of symptoms was 37 days (interquartile range 12-89). The proportions of cases with rifampicin, isoniazid and multi-drug resistant isolates were 2.4{\%}, 9.3{\%} and 2.3{\%}, respectively. 88{\%} of children completed treatment and less than 1{\%} died. CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of tuberculosis in children have remained stable, with the majority completing treatment. Rates are, however, highest in children not born in the UK, particularly among certain ethnic minority groups. Levels of drug resistance are also high.},

OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) in non-UK-born persons and compare with UK-born cases to inform public health action and health service provision. DESIGN: Analysis of surveillance data. RESULTS: Among the 67{\%} of cases who were non-UK-born, TB incidence was 88/100000 compared to 4/100000 among the UK-born. UK-born minority ethnic groups were also at increased risk of TB. Although the highest TB incidence occurred in recent entrants to the UK, nearly half the cases had been resident for {\textgreater}or=5 years. The majority of non-UK-born cases originated from South Asia (48{\%}) and sub-Saharan Africa (35{\%}). The demographic characteristics of non-UK-born and UK-born cases differed. In addition, non-UK-born cases were less likely to have pulmonary TB than the UK-born (52{\%} vs. 73{\%}, chi(2) P{\textless}0.001), but were more likely to have isoniazid-resistant disease (8{\%} vs. 6{\%}, chi(2) P=0.002), depending on region of birth. CONCLUSIONS: During 2001-2003, most TB cases were non-UK-born. TB services need to take the characteristics of TB in this group into account. Furthermore, awareness of the risk of disease is required among the non-UK-born for many years after arrival into the UK, and among UK-born minority ethnic groups.},

Ninety-six elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) were compared with 127 younger patients. The distribution of pulmonary and extrathoracic disease was similar as was the incidence of positive bacteriology. Elderly people had more frequent lower-zone and more frequent miliary shadowing, otherwise radiographic features were similar.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure to convert (persistent sputum and/or culture positivity) while on antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment at the end of the second month of anti-TB therapy has been reported to be a predictor of treatment failure. Factors that could be associated with persistent bacillary positivity at the end of the second month after initiation of anti-TB treatment were assessed.

METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 754 patients with sputum culture positive pulmonary TB in Mwanza, Tanzania. Information on social demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, BCG scar status, HIV status, CD4+ count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin and sputum culture status was obtained.

RESULTS: Factors associated with sputum culture non-conversion at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment were initial acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture grading of 3+ (OR 5.70, 95{\%} CI 1.34 to 24.31, p=0.02) and absence of a BCG scar (OR 3.35, 95{\%} CI 1.48 to 7.58, p=0.004).

CONCLUSION: Patients with pulmonary TB with no BCG scar and high initial AFB sputum intensity are at risk of remaining sputum culture positive at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment. These findings reflect a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on sputum conversion which should also be examined in large studies in other areas. The finding of a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on the treatment of pulmonary TB is important for TB control and vaccination programmes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the duration of protection by bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) may exceed previous estimates with potential implications for estimating clinical and cost-efficacy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the protection and duration of protection provided by BCG vaccination against tuberculosis, explore how this protection changes with time since vaccination, and examine the reasons behind the variation in protection and the rate of waning of protection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Databases, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Web of Knowledge, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs), MEDCARIB Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched from inception to May 2009. Index to Theses, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI) Abstracts, Scopus, Article First, Academic Complete, Africa-Wide Information, Google Scholar, Global Health, British National Bibliography for Report Literature, and clinical trial registration websites were searched from inception to October 2009.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases searches, screening of identified studies, data extraction and analysis were undertaken. Meta-analysis was used to present numerical and graphical summaries of clinical efficacy and efficacy by time since vaccination. Evidence of heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic. Meta-regression allowed the investigation of observed heterogeneity. Factors investigated included BCG strain, latitude, stringency of pre-BCG vaccination tuberculin testing, age at vaccination, site of disease, study design and vulnerability to biases. Rate of waning of protection was estimated using the ratio of the measure of efficacy after 10 years compared with the efficacy in the first 10 years of a study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Study selection. A total of 21,030 references were identified, providing data on 132 studies after abstract and full-text review. Efficacy. Protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults is variable, ranging from substantial protection in the UK MRC trial {\{}rate ratio 0.22 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.31]{\}}, to absence of clinically important benefit, as in the large Chingleput trial [rate ratio 1.05 (95{\%} CI 0.88 to 1.25)] and greater in latitudes further away from the equator. BCG vaccination efficacy was usually high, and varied little by form of disease (with higher protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis) or study design when BCG vaccination was given only to infants or to children after strict screening for tuberculin sensitivity. High levels of protection against death were observed from both trials and observational studies. The observed protective effect of BCG vaccination did not differ by the strain of BCG vaccine used in trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDURATION: Reviewed studies showed that BCG vaccination protects against pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis for up to 10 years. Most studies either did not follow up participants for long enough or had very few cases after 15 years. This should not be taken to indicate an absence of effect: five studies (one trial and four observational studies) provided evidence of measurable protection at least 15 years after vaccination. Efficacy declined with time. The rate of decline was variable, with faster decline in latitudes further from the equator and in situations where BCG vaccination was given to tuberculin-sensitive participants after stringent tuberculin testing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this review relates to quality of included trials, most of which were conducted before current standards for reporting were formulated. In addition, data were lacking in some areas and the review had to rely on evidence from observational studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BCG vaccination protection against tuberculosis varies between populations, to an extent that cannot be attributed to chance alone. Failure to exclude those already sensitised to mycobacteria and study latitude closer to the equator were associated with lower efficacy. These factors explained most of the observed variation. There is good evidence that BCG vaccination protection declines with time and that protection can last for up to 10 years. Data on protection beyond 15 years are limited; however, a small number of trials and observational studies suggest that BCG vaccination may protect for longer. Further studies are required to investigate the duration of protection by BCG vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

After a mathematical survey of the Standard Model of particle physics and GUTs, the bosonic string kinematics for the free case and with interaction is described. The effective action of the bosonic string and the spectrum is also discussed. T-duality in closed and open strings and the definition of D-brane are surveyed. Five perturbative superstring theories and their spectra is briefly outlined. Calabi-Yau three-fold compactifications of heterotic strings and their relation to some four-dimensional physics are given. Finally, non-perturbative issues like S-duality, M-theory and F-theory are also reviewed.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent trends in demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome of treatment in paediatric cases of tuberculosis. DESIGN: National surveillance study. SETTING: England and Wales. PATIENTS: All children under the age of 16 years reported with tuberculosis to the national enhanced surveillance system between 1999 and 2006 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions, and rates of disease, by demographic characteristics, site of disease, diagnostic delay, culture confirmation, species, drug susceptibility and treatment outcome. RESULTS: 3563 cases of tuberculosis in children were reported between 1999 and 2006. The incidence rate remained stable at around 4.3 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI 4.1 to 4.4). Patients born outside the UK had a tuberculosis rate higher than children born in the UK (37 per 100,000 vs 2.5 per 100,000) and this rate increased over the period. Rates in the black African ethnic group were highest at 88 per 100,000. 60{\%} of children had pulmonary disease, the commonest presentation, but only 948 (27{\%}) had culture confirmed tuberculosis. The median time to diagnosis from onset of symptoms was 37 days (interquartile range 12-89). The proportions of cases with rifampicin, isoniazid and multi-drug resistant isolates were 2.4{\%}, 9.3{\%} and 2.3{\%}, respectively. 88{\%} of children completed treatment and less than 1{\%} died. CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of tuberculosis in children have remained stable, with the majority completing treatment. Rates are, however, highest in children not born in the UK, particularly among certain ethnic minority groups. Levels of drug resistance are also high.},

As such, understanding the emergence and fitness of antibiotic-resistant subpopulations is crucial for the development of new interventions. Here we use a simple mathematical model to explain the differences in the response to isoniazid (INH) of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cells cultured under two growth rates in a chemostat. We obtain posterior distributions of model parameters consistent with data using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We explore the dynamics of diverse INH-resistant subpopulations consistent with these data in a multi-population model. We find that the simple model captures the qualitative behaviour of the cultures under both dilution rates and also present testable predictions about how diversity is maintained in such cultures.},

abstract = {National policies regarding the BCG vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community and several countries are currently considering discontinuing universal vaccination. Detractors of BCG point to its uncertain effectiveness and its interference with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). In order to quantify the trade-off between vaccination and treatment of LTBI, a mathematical model was designed and calibrated to data from Brazil, Ghana; Germany, India, Mexico, Romania, the United Kingdom and the United States. Country-specific thresholds for when LTBI treatment outperforms mass vaccination were found and the consequences of policy changes were estimated. Our results suggest that vaccination outperforms LTBI treatment in all settings but with greatly reduced efficiency in low incidence countries. While national policy statements emphasize BCG's interference with LTBI detection, we find that reinfection should be more determinant of a country's proper policy choice.},

@article{Chaulk2000,
abstract = {SETTING: From 1958 to 1978, Baltimore maintained one of the highest pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) rates in the US. But, from 1978 to 1992 its TB rate declined by 64.3{\%} and its ranking for TB fell from second highest among large US cites to twenty-eighth. This TB trend coincided with the implementation of an aggressive directly observed therapy (DOT) program by Baltimore's Health Department. OBJECTIVES: We used modeling to estimate the range of TB cases prevented in Baltimore under DOT. Case estimates equal the difference between the observed number of TB cases in Baltimore versus the expected number if Baltimore's TB trend was replaced by the TB trend for the US (low estimate) or the TB trend for all US cities with over 250,000 residents (high estimate). Economic savings are estimated. RESULTS: Without DOT we estimate there would have been between 1,577 (53.6{\%}) and 2,233 (75.9{\%}) more TB cases in Baltimore, costing {\$}18.8 million to {\$}27.1 million. Cases prevented and expenditures saved increased with increased DOT participation. CONCLUSION: Our model predicts that Baltimore's TB decline accompanying DOT resulted in health care savings equal to twice the city's total TB control budget for this period. These results are most plausibly due to DOT, since it was the only major change in Baltimore's TB control program, and rising TB risk factors-AIDS, injection drug use, poverty-in a city where TB had been epidemic should have triggered a TB increase as in comparable US cities, rather than the observed decline. As national TB rates continue to decline it will be important to identify ways to capture and reinvest these savings to support effective TB control programs.},

@article{Thomas2018,
abstract = {Background Following nearly two decades of increasing tuberculosis in the UK, TB incidence decreased by 32{\%} from 2011 to 2015. Explaining this reduction is crucial to informing ongoing TB control efforts.

Methods We stratified TB cases notified in the UK and TB cases averted in the UK through pre-entry screening (PES) between 2011 and 2015 by country of birth and time since arrival. We used population estimates and migration data to establish denominators, and calculated incidence rate ratios (IRRs) between 2011 and 2015. We calculated the contribution of changing migrant population sizes, PES and changes in TB rates to the reduction in TB notifications.

Results TB IRRs fell in all non-EU migrant and UK-born populations between 2011 and 2015 (0.61; 95{\%}  CI 0.59 to 0.64 and 0.78; 0.73 to 0.83 respectively), with the greatest decrease in recent non-EU migrants (0.54; 0.48 to 0.61). 61.9{\%} of the reduction in TB notifications was attributable to decreases in TB rates, 33.4{\%} to a fall in the number of recent/mid-term non-EU migrants and 11.4{\%} to PES. A small increase in notifications in EU-born migrants offset the reduction by 6.6{\%}.

Conclusions Large decreases in TB rates in almost all populations accounted for the majority of the reduction in TB notifications, providing evidence of the impact of recent interventions to improve UK TB control. The particularly large decrease in TB rates in recent non-EU migrants provides evidence of the effectiveness of screening interventions that target this population. These findings will inform ongoing improvements to TB control.},

abstract = {Technologies for strain differentiation and typing have made it possible to detect genetic diversity of pathogens, both within individual hosts and within communities. Coinfection of a host by more than one pathogen strain may affect the relative frequency of these strains at the population level through complex within- and between-host interactions; in infectious diseases that have a long latent period, interstrain competition during latency is likely to play an important role in disease dynamics. We show that SEIR models that include a class of latently coinfected individuals can have markedly different long-term dynamics than models without coinfection, and that coinfection can greatly facilitate the stable coexistence of strains. We demonstrate these dynamics using a model relevant to tuberculosis in which people may experience latent coinfection with both drug sensitive and drug resistant strains. Using this model, we show that the existence of a latent coinfected state allows the possibility that disease control interventions that target latency may facilitate the emergence of drug resistance.},

abstract = {Background Tuberculosis elimination in countries with a low incidence of the disease necessitates multiple interventions, including innovations in migrant screening. We examined a cohort of migrants screened for tuberculosis before entry to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland and tracked the development of disease in this group after arrival. Methods As part of a pilot pre-entry screening programme for tuberculosis in 15 countries with a high incidence of the disease, the International Organization for Migration screened all applicants for UK visas aged 11 years or older who intended to stay for more than 6 months. Applicants underwent a chest radiograph, and any with results suggestive of tuberculosis underwent sputum testing and culture testing (when available). We tracked the development of tuberculosis in those who tested negative for the disease and subsequently migrated to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland with the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system. Primary outcomes were cases of all forms of tuberculosis (including clinically diagnosed cases), and bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis. Findings Our study cohort was 519???955 migrants who were screened for tuberculosis before entry to the UK between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2012. Cases notified on the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system between Jan 1, 2006, and Dec 31, 2013, were included. 1873 incident cases of all forms of tuberculosis were identified, and, on the basis of data for England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, the estimated incidence of all forms of tuberculosis in migrants screened before entry was 147 per 100???000 person-years (95{\%} CI 140???154). The estimated incidence of bacteriologically confirmed pulmonary tuberculosis in migrants screened before entry was 49 per 100???000 person-years (95{\%} CI 45???53). Migrants whose chest radiographs were compatible with active tuberculosis but with negative pre-entry microbiological results were at increased risk of tuberculosis compared with those with no radiographic abnormalities (incidence rate ratio 3??2, 95{\%} CI 2??8???3??7; p{\textless}0??0001). Incidence of tuberculosis after migration increased significantly with increasing WHO-estimated prevalence of tuberculosis in migrants' countries of origin. 35 of 318???983 pre-entry screened migrants included in a secondary analysis with typing data were assumed index cases. Estimates of the rate of assumed reactivation tuberculosis ranged from 46 (95{\%} CI 42???52) to 91 (82???102) per 100???000 population. Interpretation Migrants from countries with a high incidence of tuberculosis screened before being granted entry to low-incidence countries pose a negligible risk of onward transmission but are at increased risk of tuberculosis, which could potentially be prevented through identification and treatment of latent infection in close collaboration with a pre-entry screening programme.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is resistant to both rifampicin (RIF) and isoniazid (INH). Whereas many TB diagnostics detect RIF-resistance, few detect INH-monoresistance, which is common and may increase risk of acquired MDR-TB. Whether inclusion of INH-resistance in a first-line rapid test for TB would have an important impact on MDR-TB rates remains uncertain. METHODS: WE DEVELOPED A TRANSMISSION MODEL TO EVALUATE THREE TESTS IN A POPULATION SIMILAR TO THAT OF INDIA: a rapid molecular test for TB, the same test plus RIF-resistance detection ("TB+RIF"), and detection of RIF and INH-resistance ("TB+RIF/INH"). Our primary outcome was the prevalence of INH-resistant and MDR-TB at ten years. RESULTS: Compared to the TB test alone and assuming treatment of all diagnosed MDR cases, the TB+RIF test reduced the prevalence of MDR-TB among all TB cases from 5.5{\%} to 3.8{\%} (30.6{\%} reduction, 95{\%} uncertainty range, UR: 17-54{\%}). Despite using liberal assumptions about the impact of INH-monoresistance on treatment outcomes and MDR-TB acquisition, expansion from TB+RIF to TB+RIF/INH lowered this prevalence only from 3.8{\%} to 3.6{\%} further (4{\%} reduction, 95{\%} UR: 3-7{\%}) and INH-monoresistant TB from 15.8{\%} to 15.1{\%} (4{\%} reduction, 95{\%} UR: (-8)-19{\%}). CONCLUSION: When added to a rapid test for TB plus RIF-resistance, detection of INH-resistance has minimal impact on transmission of TB, MDR-TB, and INH-monoresistant TB.},

abstract = {A new model for the transmission dynamics of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and bovine tuberculosis in a community, consisting of humans and African buffalos, is presented. The buffalo-only component of the model exhibits the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, which arises due to the reinfection of exposed and recovered buffalos, when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. This model has a unique endemic equilibrium, which is globally asymptotically stable for a special case, when the reproduction number exceeds unity. Uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, using data relevant to the dynamics of the two diseases in the Kruger National Park, show that the distribution of the associated reproduction number is less than unity (hence, the diseases would not persist in the community). Crucial parameters that influence the dynamics of the two diseases are also identified. Both the buffalo-only and the buffalo-human model exhibit the same qualitative dynamics with respect to the local and global asymptotic stability of their respective disease-free equilibrium, as well as with respect to the backward bifurcation phenomenon. Numerical simulations of the buffalo-human model show that the cumulative number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis cases in humans (buffalos) decreases with increasing number of bovine tuberculosis infections in humans (buffalo).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Xpert MTB/RIF test enables rapid detection of tuberculosis (TB) and rifampicin resistance. The World Health Organization recommends Xpert for initial diagnosis in individuals suspected of having multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) or HIV-associated TB, and many countries are moving quickly toward adopting Xpert. As roll-out proceeds, it is essential to understand the potential health impact and cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies based on Xpert. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We evaluated potential health and economic consequences of implementing Xpert in five southern African countries--Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland--where drug resistance and TB-HIV coinfection are prevalent. Using a calibrated, dynamic mathematical model, we compared the status quo diagnostic algorithm, emphasizing sputum smear, against an algorithm incorporating Xpert for initial diagnosis. Results were projected over 10- and 20-y time periods starting from 2012. Compared to status quo, implementation of Xpert would avert 132,000 (95{\%} CI: 55,000-284,000) TB cases and 182,000 (97,000-302,000) TB deaths in southern Africa over the 10 y following introduction, and would reduce prevalence by 28{\%} (14{\%}-40{\%}) by 2022, with more modest reductions in incidence. Health system costs are projected to increase substantially with Xpert, by US{\$}460 million (294-699 million) over 10 y. Antiretroviral therapy for HIV represents a substantial fraction of these additional costs, because of improved survival in TB/HIV-infected populations through better TB case-finding and treatment. Costs for treating MDR-TB are also expected to rise significantly with Xpert scale-up. Relative to status quo, Xpert has an estimated cost-effectiveness of US{\$}959 (633-1,485) per disability-adjusted life-year averted over 10 y. Across countries, cost-effectiveness ratios ranged from US{\$}792 (482-1,785) in Swaziland to US{\$}1,257 (767-2,276) in Botswana. Assessing outcomes over a 10-y period focuses on the near-term consequences of Xpert adoption, but the cost-effectiveness results are conservative, with cost-effectiveness ratios assessed over a 20-y time horizon approximately 20{\%} lower than the 10-y values. CONCLUSIONS: Introduction of Xpert could substantially change TB morbidity and mortality through improved case-finding and treatment, with more limited impact on long-term transmission dynamics. Despite extant uncertainty about TB natural history and intervention impact in southern Africa, adoption of Xpert evidently offers reasonable value for its cost, based on conventional benchmarks for cost-effectiveness. However, the additional financial burden would be substantial, including significant increases in costs for treating HIV and MDR-TB. Given the fundamental influence of HIV on TB dynamics and intervention costs, care should be taken when interpreting the results of this analysis outside of settings with high HIV prevalence.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the natural history of tuberculosis are poorly understood. Though it is recognized that clinical tuberculosis may follow shortly after initial infection ('primary' disease), or many years thereafter through either endogenous reactivation or after reinfection, the relative importance of these mechanisms is often disputed. The issue is complicated by the fact that the risks of developing disease are age-dependent, and reflect infection risks which may change over time. This paper estimates the age-dependent risks of developing tuberculosis using an age-structured deterministic model of the dynamics of tuberculous infection and disease in England and Wales since 1900. The work extends the classical studies of Sutherland and colleagues. The best estimates of the risks of developing 'primary' disease (within 5 years of initial infection) were approximately 4{\%}, 9{\%} and 14{\%} for individuals infected at ages 0-10, 15 years and over 20 years respectively, and a previous infection appeared to impart little protection against (further) reinfection, but 16-41{\%} protection against disease subsequent to reinfection for adolescents and adults. We also provide evidence that reinfection made an important contribution to tuberculous morbidity in the past, as (i) exclusion of exogenous disease from the model considerably worsened the fit to observed notification rates, and (ii) the dramatic decline in the risk of tuberculous infection from 1950 in England and Wales accelerated the decline in morbidity among all individuals, even among the older age groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection. We conclude that the risk of infection is the single most important factor affecting the magnitude of the tuberculous morbidity in a population, as it determines both the age pattern of initial infection (and hence the risk of developing disease) and the risk of reinfection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Because metabolism is fundamental in sustaining microbial life, drugs that target pathogen-specific metabolic enzymes and pathways can be very effective. In particular, the metabolic challenges faced by intracellular pathogens, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, residing in the infected host provide novel opportunities for therapeutic intervention. RESULTS: We developed a mathematical framework to simulate the effects on the growth of a pathogen when enzymes in its metabolic pathways are inhibited. Combining detailed models of enzyme kinetics, a complete metabolic network description as modeled by flux balance analysis, and a dynamic cell population growth model, we quantitatively modeled and predicted the dose-response of the 3-nitropropionate inhibitor on the growth of M. tuberculosis in a medium whose carbon source was restricted to fatty acids, and that of the 5'-O-(N-salicylsulfamoyl) adenosine inhibitor in a medium with low-iron concentration. CONCLUSION: The predicted results quantitatively reproduced the experimentally measured dose-response curves, ranging over three orders of magnitude in inhibitor concentration. Thus, by allowing for detailed specifications of the underlying enzymatic kinetics, metabolic reactions/constraints, and growth media, our model captured the essential chemical and biological factors that determine the effects of drug inhibition on in vitro growth of M. tuberculosis cells.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to link transmission dynamics with a probabilistic risk model to provide a mechanistically explicit assessment for estimating the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) infection risk in regions of Taiwan. METHODS: A relative fitness (RF)-based MDR TB model was used to describe transmission, validated with disease data for the period 2006-2010. A dose-response model quantifying by basic reproduction number (R(0)) and total proportion of infected population was constructed to estimate the site-specific MDR TB infection risk. RESULTS: We found that the incidence rate of MDR TB was highest in Hwalien County (4.91 per 100,000 population) in eastern Taiwan, with drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant R(0) estimates of 0.89 (95{\%} CI 0.23-2.17) and 0.38 (95{\%} CI 0.05-1.30), respectively. The predictions were in apparent agreement with observed data in the 95{\%} credible intervals. Our simulation showed that the incidence of MDR TB will be falling by 2013-2016. Our results indicated that the selected regions of Taiwan had only approximately 1{\%} probability of exceeding 50{\%} of the population with infection attributed to MDR TB. CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that the ongoing control programs implemented in Taiwan may succeed in curing most patients with MDR TB and will reduce the TB incidence countrywide.},

abstract = {Granulomas play a centric role in tuberculosis (TB) infection progression. Multiple granulomas usually develop within a single host. These granulomas are not synchronized in size or bacteria load, and will follow different trajectories over time. How the fate of individual granulomas influence overall infection outcome at host scale is not understood, although computational models have been developed to predict single granuloma behavior. Here we present a within-host population model that tracks granulomas in two key organs during Mycobacteria tuberculosis (Mtb) infection: lung and lymph nodes (LN). We capture various time courses of TB progression, including latency and reactivation. The model predicts that there is no steady state; rather it is a continuous process of progressing to active disease over differing time periods. This is consistent with recently posed ideas suggesting that latent TB exists as a spectrum of states and not a single state. The model also predicts a dual role for granuloma development in LNs during Mtb infection: in early phases of infection granulomas suppress infection by providing additional antigens to the site of immune priming; however, this induces a more rapid reactivation at later stages by disrupting immune responses. We identify mechanisms that strongly correlate with better host-level outcomes, including elimination of uncontained lung granulomas by inducing low levels of lung tissue damage and inhibition of bacteria dissemination within the lung.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Routinely collected data from tuberculosis surveillance system can be used to investigate and monitor the irregularities and abrupt changes of the disease incidence. We aimed at using a Hidden Markov Model in order to detect the abnormal states of pulmonary tuberculosis in Iran. METHODS: Data for this study were the weekly number of newly diagnosed cases with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis reported between April 2005 and March 2011 throughout Iran. In order to detect the unusual states of the disease, two Hidden Markov Models were applied to the data with and without seasonal trends as baselines. Consequently, the best model was selected and compared with the results of Serfling epidemic threshold which is typically used in the surveillance of infectious diseases. RESULTS: Both adjusted R-squared and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) reflected better goodness-of-fit for the model with seasonal trends (0.72 and -1336.66, respectively) than the model without seasonality (0.56 and -1386.75). Moreover, according to the Serfling epidemic threshold, higher values of sensitivity and specificity suggest a higher validity for the seasonal model (0.87 and 0.94, respectively) than model without seasonality (0.73 and 0.68, respectively). CONCLUSION: A two-state Hidden Markov Model along with a seasonal trend as a function of the model parameters provides an effective warning system for the surveillance of tuberculosis.},

A sensitivity analysis of model parameters is performed and the most sensitive ones are identified by means of a state-of-the-art Gauss-Newton method. In particular, parameters representing the proportion of individuals having access to medical facilities are seen to have a large impact on the dynamics of the disease.

abstract = {Multidrug-resistant and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) represent an important challenge for global tuberculosis (TB) control. The high rates of MDR/RR-TB observed among re-treatment cases can arise from diverse pathways: de novo amplification during initial treatment, inappropriate treatment of undiagnosed MDR/RR-TB, relapse despite appropriate treatment, or reinfection with MDR/RR-TB. Mathematical modelling allows quantification of the contribution made by these pathways in different settings. This information provides valuable insights for TB policy-makers, allowing better contextualised solutions. However, mathematical modelling outputs need to consider local data and be easily accessible to decision makers in order to improve their usefulness. We present a user-friendly web-based modelling interface, which can be used by people without technical knowledge. Users can input their own parameter values and produce estimates for their specific setting. This innovative tool provides easy access to mathematical modelling outputs that are highly relevant to national TB control programs. In future, the same approach could be applied to a variety of modelling applications, enhancing local decision making.},

abstract = {Factors driving the increase in drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in the Eastern Cape Province, South Africa, are not understood. A convenience sample of 309 drug-susceptible and 342 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB isolates, collected July 2008-July 2009, were characterized by spoligotyping, DNA fingerprinting, insertion site mapping, and targeted DNA sequencing. Analysis of molecular-based data showed diverse genetic backgrounds among drug-sensitive and MDR TB sensu stricto isolates in contrast to restricted genetic backgrounds among pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR TB isolates. Second-line drug resistance was significantly associated with the atypical Beijing genotype. DNA fingerprinting and sequencing demonstrated that the pre-XDR and XDR atypical Beijing isolates evolved from a common progenitor; 85{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively, were clustered, indicating transmission. Ninety-three percent of atypical XDR Beijing isolates had mutations that confer resistance to 10 anti-TB drugs, and some isolates also were resistant to para-aminosalicylic acid. These findings suggest the emergence of totally drug-resistant TB.},

Drug-sensitive and MDR TB has diverse background

pre-XDR TB and XDR TB has a more restricted genetic background (commom ancestor)

Second-line DR associated with Beijing isolates (85{\%}, pre-XDR TB, 92{\%} XDR TB clustered therefore common ancestory)

Atypical (lacking commone IS6110 element) carried most MDR resistance. found that higher resistances lead to higher proportion coming from atypical genotype.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Travelers to countries with high tuberculosis incidence can acquire infection during travel. We sought to compare four screening interventions for travelers from low-incidence countries, who visit countries with varying tuberculosis incidence. METHODS: Decision analysis model: We considered hypothetical cohorts of 1,000 travelers, 21 years old, visiting Mexico, the Dominican Republic, or Haiti for three months. Travelers departed from and returned to the United States or Canada; they were born in the United States, Canada, or the destination countries. The time horizon was 20 years, with 3{\%} annual discounting of future costs and outcomes. The analysis was conducted from the health care system perspective. Screening involved tuberculin skin testing (post-travel in three strategies, with baseline pre-travel tests in two), or chest radiography post-travel (one strategy). Returning travelers with tuberculin conversion (one strategy) or other evidence of latent tuberculosis (three strategies) were offered treatment. The main outcome was cost (in 2005 US dollars) per tuberculosis case prevented. RESULTS: For all travelers, a single post-trip tuberculin test was most cost-effective. The associated cost estimate per case prevented ranged from {\$}21,406 for Haitian-born travelers to Haiti, to {\$}161,196 for US-born travelers to Mexico. In all sensitivity analyses, the single post-trip tuberculin test remained most cost-effective. For US-born travelers to Haiti, this strategy was associated with cost savings for trips over 22 months. Screening was more cost-effective with increasing trip duration and infection risk, and less so with poorer treatment adherence. CONCLUSION: A single post-trip tuberculin skin test was the most cost-effective strategy considered, for travelers from the United States or Canada. The analysis did not evaluate the use of interferon-gamma release assays, which would be most relevant for travelers who received BCG vaccination after infancy, as in many European countries. Screening decisions should reflect duration of travel, tuberculosis incidence, and commitment to treat latent infection.},

abstract = {Abstract A two strain tuberculosis model with treatment which allows TB patients with the drug sensitive of strain Mycobacterium tuberculosis to be cured is presented. The model is further extended to incorporate quarantine for active TB cases with multi?drug resistant TB strains. The model assumes that latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of endogenous activation and exogenous reinfection. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity, boundedness and persistence of solutions are presented. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stability of the solution is analyzed. From the study we conclude that quarantine of the multi?drug resistant tuberculosis cases reduces the multi?drug resistant tuberculosis induced reproduction number to values below unit, thus this intervention strategy can control the development of multi?drug resistant tuberculosis epidemic. Also effective chemoprophylaxis and treatment of infectives result in a reduction of multi?drug resistant tuberculosis cases since most multi?drug resistant tuberculosis cases are a result of inappropriate treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the population-level impact of two World Health Organization-endorsed strategies for improving the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB): same-day microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid, USA). METHODS: We created a compartmental transmission model of TB in a representative African community, fit to the regional incidence and mortality of TB and HIV. We compared the population-level reduction in TB burden over ten years achievable with implementation over two years of same-day microscopy, Xpert MTB/RIF testing, and the combination of both approaches. FINDINGS: Same-day microscopy averted an estimated 11.0{\%} of TB incidence over ten years (95{\%} uncertainty range, UR: 3.3{\%}-22.5{\%}), and prevented 11.8{\%} of all TB deaths (95{\%} UR: 7.7{\%}-27.1{\%}). Scaling up Xpert MTB/RIF to all centralized laboratories to achieve 75{\%} population coverage had similar impact on incidence (9.3{\%} reduction, 95{\%} UR: 1.9{\%}-21.5{\%}) and greater effect on mortality (23.8{\%} reduction, 95{\%} UR: 8.6{\%}-33.4{\%}). Combining the two strategies (i.e., same-day microscopy plus Xpert MTB/RIF) generated synergistic effects: an 18.7{\%} reduction in incidence (95{\%} UR: 5.6{\%}-39.2{\%}) and 33.1{\%} reduction in TB mortality (95{\%} UR: 18.1{\%}-50.2{\%}). By the end of year ten, combining same-day microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF could reduce annual TB mortality by 44{\%} relative to the current standard of care. CONCLUSION: Scaling up novel diagnostic tests for TB and optimizing existing ones are complementary strategies that, when combined, may have substantial impact on TB epidemics in Africa.},

abstract = {Global eradication of tuberculosis (TB) is an international agenda. Thus understanding effects of treatment of TB in different settings is crucial. In previous work, we introduced the framework for a mathematical model of epidemic TB in demographically distinct, heterogeneous populations. Simulations showed the importance of genetic susceptibility in determining endemic prevalence levels. In the work presented here, we include treatment and investigate different strategies for treatment of latent and active TB disease in heterogeneous populations. We illustrate how the presence of a genetically susceptible subpopulation dramatically alters effects of treatment in the same way a core population does in the setting of sexually transmitted diseases. In addition, we evaluate treatment strategies that focus specifically on this subpopulation, and our results indicate that genetically susceptible subpopulations should be accounted for when designing treatment strategies to achieve the greatest reduction in disease prevalence.},

abstract = {SUMMARYOver 50{\%} of the global burden of tuberculosis occurs in South East Asia and the Western Pacific. Since 1950, notification rates in high-income countries in these settings have declined slowly and have remained over ten-fold greater than those in Western populations. The reasons for the slow decline are poorly understood. Using an age-structured model describing the incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease applied to notification data from Hong Kong, we illustrate that in Hong Kong, a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection among older individuals and a high risk of disease through reactivation (e.g. up to 17-fold greater than that estimated for infected males in the United Kingdom) may explain this slow decline. If this feature of the epidemiology of tuberculosis is widespread, the WHO directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy may have a smaller impact in Asia in the short term than has been implied by recent predictions, all of which have been based on disease risk estimates derived from Western Europe. As a result, it may be difficult to meet the targets for tuberculosis control, which have been prescribed by the UN Millennium Development Goals.},

abstract = {Finding more effective vaccines against tuberculosis (TB) and improved preventive treatments against endogenous reactivation of latent TB is strategic to block transmission and reach the WHO goal of eliminating TB by 2050. Key related open questions in TB research include: i) what are the determinants of a strong memory response upon primary infection? ii) what is the role of cytokines towards protective memory response against a secondary infection? iii) what are the mechanisms responsible for the increased risk of reactivation in elderly individuals? To address these questions, we explored a computational model of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis including a mathematical description of immunosenescence and the generation and maintenance of immune memory. Sensitivity analysis techniques, together with extensive model characterization and in silico experiments, were applied to identify key mechanisms controlling TB reactivation and immunological memory. Key findings of this study are summarized by the following model predictions: i) increased strength and duration of memory protection is associated with higher levels of Tumor Necrosis Factor-[Formula: see text] (TNF) during primary infection; ii) production of TNF, but not of interferon-[Formula: see text], by memory T cells during secondary infection is a major determinant of effective protection; iii) impaired recruitment of CD4+ T cells may promote reactivation of latent TB infections in aging hosts. This study is a first attempt to consider the immune dynamics of a persistent infection throughout the lifetime of the host, taking into account immunosenescence and memory. While the model is TB specific, the results are applicable to other persistent bacterial infections and can aid in the development, evaluation and refinement of TB treatment and/or vaccine protocols.},

Participants who were tuberculin positive on entry were left unvaccinated; those who were tuberculin negative were allocated at random to an unvaccinated or to a vaccinated group. The protective efficacy of each of the two vaccines, among those initially tuberculin negative, was 84{\%} during the first five years, and gradually decreased, averaging 77{\%} for each vaccine over the whole period. The incidence of tuberculosis decreased substantially in all groups during the trial, however, and of the total of 610 cases of tuberculosis only 27 developed between 15 and 20 years. Thus we cannot make a reliable assessment of efficacy during this final period. The prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in Great Britain have decreased radically since this trial began.

abstract = {Intense use of antibiotics for the treatment of diseases such as tuberculosis, malaria, Staphylococcus aureus or gonorrhea has led to rapidly increasing population levels of drug resistance. This has generally necessitated a switch to new drugs and the discontinuation of older ones, after which resistance often only declines slowly or even persists indefinitely. These long-term effects are usually ascribed to low fitness costs of resistance in absence of the drug. Here we show that structure in the host population, in particular heterogeneity in number of contacts, also plays an important role in the reversion dynamics. Host contact structure acts both during the phase of intense treatment, leading to non-random distributions of the resistant strain among the infected population, and after the discontinuation of the drug, by affecting the competition dynamics resulting in a mitigation of fitness advantages. As a consequence, we observe both a lower rate of reversion and a lower probability that reversion to sensitivity on the population level occurs after treatment is stopped. Our simulations show that the impact of heterogeneity in the host structure is maximal in the biologically most plausible parameter range, namely when fitness costs of resistance are small.},

abstract = {The ongoing explosion of antibiotic-resistant infections continues to plague global and US health care. Meanwhile, an equally alarming decline has occurred in the research and development of new antibiotics to deal with the threat. In response to this microbial "perfect storm," in 2001, the federal Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance released the "Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance; Part 1: Domestic" to strengthen the response in the United States. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) followed in 2004 with its own report, "Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic Discovery Stagnates, A Public Health Crisis Brews," which proposed incentives to reinvigorate pharmaceutical investment in antibiotic research and development. The IDSA's subsequent lobbying efforts led to the introduction of promising legislation in the 109 th US Congress (January 2005-December 2006). Unfortunately, the legislation was not enacted. During the 110 th Congress, the IDSA has continued to work with congressional leaders on promising legislation to address antibiotic-resistant infection. Nevertheless, despite intensive public relations and lobbying efforts, it remains unclear whether sufficiently robust legislation will be enacted. In the meantime, microbes continue to become more resistant, the antibiotic pipeline continues to diminish, and the majority of the public remains unaware of this critical situation. The result of insufficient federal funding; insufficient surveillance, prevention, and control; insufficient research and development activities; misguided regulation of antibiotics in agriculture and, in particular, for food animals; and insufficient overall coordination of US (and international) efforts could mean a literal return to the preantibiotic era for many types of infections. If we are to address the antimicrobial resistance crisis, a concerted, grassroots effort led by the medical community will be required},

The stages were early HIV disease, late HIV disease and AIDS. The main strategies were TB treatment followed by anti-retroviral therapy (ART) after delays of 15 days, 2 months and 6 months. ART followed by TB treatment was an additional strategy that was tested. Treatment was simulated with and without drug interaction. Simulation results were that TB treatment first followed by ART after a stage-dependent delay has the best outcome. During early HIV disease a 6 month delay is acceptable. During late HIV disease, a 2 month delay is best. During AIDS it is better to start ART after 15 days. However, drug interaction works against the benefits of early ART. These results agree with expert reviews and clinical trials.},

The approach proposed by Styblo in 1985 is known to be inaccurate in the modern era where there is widespread availability of treatment for TB. This study re-examines the relationship of incidence to prevalence and other disease indicators that can be derived from surveys. We adapt a simple, previously published model that describes the epidemiology of TB in the presence of treatment to investigate a revised ratio-based approach to estimating incidence. We show that, following changes to treatment programmes for TB, the ratio of incidence to prevalence reaches an equilibrium value rapidly; long before other model indicators have stabilized. We also show that this ratio relies on few parameters but is strongly dependent on, and requires knowledge of, the efficacy and timeliness of treatment.},

abstract = {The deterministic dynamics of populations in continuous time are traditionally described using coupled, first-order ordinary differential equations. While this approach is accurate for large systems, it is often inadequate for small systems where key species may be present in small numbers or where key reactions occur at a low rate. The Gillespie stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) is a procedure for generating time-evolution trajectories of finite populations in continuous time and has become the standard algorithm for these types of stochastic models. This article presents a simple-to-use and flexible framework for implementing the SSA using the high-level statistical computing language R and the package GillespieSSA. Using three ecological models as examples (logistic growth, Rosenzweig-MacArthur predator-prey model, and Kermack-McKendrick SIRS metapopulation model), this paper shows how a deterministic model can be formulated as a finite-population stochastic model within the framework of SSA theory and how it can be implemented in R. Simulations of the stochastic models are performed using four different SSA Monte Carlo methods: one exact method (Gillespie's direct method); and three approximate methods (explicit, binomial, and optimized tau-leap methods). Comparison of simulation results confirms that while the time-evolution trajectories obtained from the different SSA methods are indistinguishable, the approximate methods are up to four orders of magnitude faster than the exact methods.},

abstract = {Minisatellites are highly variable tandem repeats used for over 20 years in humans for DNA fingerprinting. In prokaryotes fingerprinting techniques exploiting VNTR (variable number of tandem repeats) polymorphisms have become widely used recently in bacterial typing. However although many investigations into the mechanisms underlying minisatellite variation in humans have been performed, relatively little is known about the processes that mediate bacterial minisatellite polymorphism. An understanding of this is important since it will influence how the results from VNTR experiments are interpreted. The minisatellites of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are well characterized since they are some of the few polymorphic loci in what is otherwise a very homogeneous organism. Using VNTR results from a well-defined and characterized set of M. tuberculosis strains we show that the repeats at a locus are likely to evolve by stepwise contraction or expansion in the number of repeats. A stochastic continuous-time population mathematical model was developed to simulate the evolution of the repeats. This allowed estimation of the tendency of the repeats to increase or decrease and the rate at which they change. The majority of loci tend to lose rather than gain repeats. All of the loci mutate extremely slowly, with an average rate of 2.3 x 10(-8), which is 350 times slower than that of a set of VNTR repeats with similar diversity observed experimentally in Escherichia coli. This suggests that the VNTR profile of a strain of M. tuberculosis will be indicative of its clonal lineage and will be unlikely to vary in epidemiologically-related strains.},

abstract = {The importance of exogenous reinfection versus endogenous reactivation for the resurgence of tuberculosis (TB) has been a matter of ongoing debate. Previous mathematical models of TB give conflicting results on the possibility of multiple stable equilibria in the presence of reinfection, and hence the failure to control the disease even when the basic reproductive number is less than unity. The present study reconsiders the effect of exogenous reinfection, by extending previous studies to incorporate a generalized rate of reinfection as a function of the number of actively infected individuals. A mathematical model is developed to include all possible routes to the development of active TB (progressive primary infection, endogenous reactivation, and exogenous reinfection). The model is qualitatively analyzed to show the existence of multiple equilibria under realistic assumptions and plausible range of parameter values. Two examples, of unbounded and saturated incidence rates of reinfection, are given, and simulation results using estimated parameter values are presented. The results reflect exogenous reinfection as a major cause of TB emergence, especially in high prevalence areas, with important public health implications for controlling its spread.},

abstract = {High resolution tests for genetic variation reveal that individuals may simultaneously host more than one distinct strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Previous studies find that this phenomenon, which we will refer to as "mixed infection", may affect the outcomes of treatment for infected individuals and may influence the impact of population-level interventions against tuberculosis. In areas where the incidence of TB is high, mixed infections have been found in nearly 20{\%} of patients; these studies may underestimate the actual prevalence of mixed infection given that tests may not be sufficiently sensitive for detecting minority strains. Specific reasons for failing to detect mixed infections would include low initial numbers of minority strain cells in sputum, stochastic growth in culture and the physical division of initial samples into parts (typically only one of which is genotyped). In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that models the study designs aimed to detect mixed infections. Using both a deterministic and a stochastic approach, we obtain posterior estimates of the prevalence of mixed infection. We find that the posterior estimate of the prevalence of mixed infection may be substantially higher than the fraction of cases in which it is detected. We characterize this bias in terms of the sensitivity of the genotyping method and the relative growth rates and initial population sizes of the different strains collected in sputum.},

abstract = {Measurement error in explanatory variables and unmeasured confounders can cause considerable problems in epidemiologic studies. It is well recognized that under certain conditions, nondifferential measurement error in the exposure variable produces bias towards the null. Measurement error in confounders will lead to residual confounding, but this is not a straightforward issue, and it is not clear in which direction the bias will point. Unmeasured confounders further complicate matters. There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding. In this paper, the authors use simulation studies and logistic regression analyses to investigate the size of the apparent exposure-outcome association that can occur when in truth the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. The authors consider two cases with a normally distributed exposure and either two or four normally distributed confounders. When the confounders are uncorrelated, bias in the exposure effect estimate increases as the amount of residual and unmeasured confounding increases. Patterns are more complex for correlated confounders. With plausible assumptions, effect sizes of the magnitude frequently reported in observational epidemiologic studies can be generated by residual and/or unmeasured confounding alone.},

It sets out the key actions needed to achieve the targets of the Millennium Development Goals relating to tuberculosis (T13): to halve the prevalence and deaths by 2015 relative to 1990 levels and to save 14 million lives. Developed by a broad coalition of partners, the plan presents a model approach combining interventions that can feasibly be supplied on the ground. The main areas of activity set out in the plan are: scaling up interventions to control tuberculosis; promoting the research and development of improved diagnostics, drugs and vaccines; and engaging in related activities for advocacy, communications and social mobilization. Scenarios for the planning process were developed; these looked at issues both globally and in seven epidemiological regions. The scenarios made ambitious but realistic assumptions about the pace of scale-up and implementation coverage of the activities. A mathematical model was used to estimate the impact of scaling up current interventions based on data from studies of tuberculosis biology and from experience with tuberculosis control in diverse settings. The estimated costs of the activities set out in the Global Plan were based on implementing interventions and researching and developing drugs, diagnostics and vaccines; these costs were US{\$} 56 billion over 10 years. When translated into cost per disability adjusted life year averted, these costs compare favourably with those of other public health interventions. This approach to planning for global tuberculosis control is a valuable example of developing plans to improve global health that has relevance for other health issues.},

This computational methodology is particularly useful for analyzing the dynamics of protein-ligand systems. Several uses of molecular dynamics simulation makes possible evaluation of important structural features found at interface between a ligand and a protein, such as intermolecular hydrogen bonds, contact area and binding energy. Considering structure-based virtual screening, molecular dynamics simulations play a pivotal role in understanding the features that are important for ligand-binding affinity. This information could be employed to select higher-affinity ligands obtained in screening processes. Many protein targets such as enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (InhA), purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP), and shikimate kinase have been submitted to these simulations and will be analyzed here.

abstract = {Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO) and the widely applicable information criterion (WAIC) are methods for estimating pointwise out-of-sample prediction accuracy from a fitted Bayesian model using the log-likelihood evaluated at the posterior simulations of the parameter values. LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques permit inferences in complex demographic models, but are computationally inefficient. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach has been proposed (Marjoram et al. 2003), but it suffers from computational problems and poor mixing. We propose several methodological developments to overcome the shortcomings of this MCMC approach and hence realize substantial computational advances over standard ABC. The principal idea is to relax the tolerance within MCMC to permit good mixing, but retain a good approximation to the posterior by a combination of subsampling the output and regression adjustment. We also propose to use a partial least-squares (PLS) transformation to choose informative statistics. The accuracy of our approach is examined in the case of the divergence of two populations with and without migration. In that case, our ABC-MCMC approach needs considerably lower computation time to reach the same accuracy than conventional ABC. We then apply our method to a more complex case with the estimation of divergence times and migration rates between three African populations.},

Results showed that triple antiretroviral therapy (ARV) plus antibiotics would prolong life by 6.7 undiscounted years if provided 'late' (CD4 = 200 cells/microl) and by 9.8 years if provided 'early' (CD4 = 350 cells/microl).

The discounted incremental costs per quality adjusted life year (QALY) gained were, respectively, {\$}29 saving, {\$}254, {\$}4937 and {\$}3057. Late ARV plus both antibiotics was the strategy most likely to be cost effective if society was willing to pay more than {\$}2000 per life year gained.

abstract = {Multi-drug therapy is the standard-of-care treatment for tuberculosis. Despite this, virtually all studies of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of mycobacterial drugs employed for the design of treatment protocols are restricted to single agents. In this report, mathematical models and in vitro experiments with Mycobacterium marinum and five antimycobacterial drugs are used to quantitatively evaluate the pharmaco-, population and evolutionary dynamics of two-drug antimicrobial chemotherapy regimes. Time kill experiments with single and pairs of antibiotics are used to estimate the parameters and evaluate the fit of Hill-function-based PD models. While Hill functions provide excellent fits for the PD of each single antibiotic studied, rifampin, amikacin, clarithromycin, streptomycin and moxifloxacin, two-drug Hill functions with a unique interaction parameter cannot account for the PD of any of the 10 pairs of these drugs. If we assume two antibiotic-concentration dependent functions for the interaction parameter, one for sub-MIC and one for supra-MIC drug concentrations, the modified biphasic Hill function provides a reasonably good fit for the PD of all 10 pairs of antibiotics studied. Monte Carlo simulations of antibiotic treatment based on the experimentally-determined PD functions are used to evaluate the potential microbiological efficacy (rate of clearance) and evolutionary consequences (likelihood of generating multi-drug resistance) of these different drug combinations as well as their sensitivity to different forms of non-adherence to therapy. These two-drug treatment simulations predict varying outcomes for the different pairs of antibiotics with respect to the aforementioned measures of efficacy. In summary, Hill functions with biphasic drug-drug interaction terms provide accurate analogs for the PD of pairs of antibiotics and M. marinum. The models, experimental protocols and computer simulations used in this study can be applied to evaluate the potential microbiological and evolutionary efficacy of two-drug therapy for any bactericidal antibiotics and bacteria that can be cultured in vitro.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effective screening and treatment strategies for healthcare workers (HCWs) at risk for tuberculosis exposure. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to track three hypothetical cohorts of HCWs at low, moderate, and high risk for tuberculosis exposure. For those found to be tuberculin reactors at entry, the choice was for isoniazid treatment or no treatment. For those without tuberculin reactivity, the choice of screening intervals was 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 5 years. Outcomes measured were tuberculosis cases, death, life expectancy, and cost. Assumptions were derived from published data and analyses. RESULTS: Treatment of initial reactors with isoniazid in all three risk groups was associated with a net savings of {\$}14,800 to {\$}15,700 for each tuberculosis case prevented. For those without evidence of infection at entry, the most cost-effective screening interval was 1 year for high-risk groups, 2 years for moderate-risk groups, and 5 years for low-risk groups, with a net savings {\$}0.20 to {\$}26 per HCW per year. Screening at a more frequent interval was still cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: For HCWs found to be tuberculin reactors, treatment of their latent infection is to their benefit and is associated with a net cost-savings. Regular tuberculin screening of HCWs can be cost-effective or result in a net cost-savings. Each institution could use its own skin test surveillance data to create an optimum screening program for its employees. However, for most HCWs, a 1-year screening interval would be a cost-effective and safe choice.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is among the top ten causes of death worldwide. The impacts of potential control measures on TB infection in senior care facilities are poorly understood in Taiwan region. The purpose of this paper was to assess the impacts of potential control strategies for reducing the risk for TB infection among elderly in senior care facilities and to provide the suggestions for sound TB infection control measures that should be implemented in all senior care facilities with aged people suspected of having infectious TB. We proposed an integrated-level mathematical model, incorporating the TB transmission dynamics, the Wells-Riley mathematical equation, and the competing-risks model to quantify the potential spread of TB bacilli in senior care facilities. We found that individuals living in hospital-based nursing homes had much higher exposure to TB than those in long-term and domiciliary care facilities. We showed that the proposed combinations of engineering control measures (e.g., ventilation and ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) with personal protection (e.g., surgical mask) guarantee the provision of a reliable control strategy to decrease the transmission potential and spread rate of TB bacilli aerosols in senior care facilities in that the efficacies range from 45 to 90{\%}. The introduction of appropriate TB transmission control measures may decrease TB annual incidence in senior care facilities by as much as 76-90{\%} of tuberculin skin test (TST) conversion. Our study implicated that sound TB infection control measures, including diagnosis and prompt treatment of infectious cases should be prioritized. (c) 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) has re-emerged over the past two decades: in industrialized countries in association with immigration, and in Africa owing to the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic. Drug-resistant TB is a major threat worldwide. The variable and uncertain impact of TB control necessitates not only better tools (diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines), but also better insights into the natural history and epidemiology of TB. Molecular epidemiological studies over the last two decades have contributed to such insights by answering long-standing questions, such as the proportion of cases attributable to recent transmission, risk factors for recent transmission, the occurrence of multiple Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and the proportion of recurrent TB cases attributable to re-infection. M. tuberculosis lineages have been identified and shown to be associated with geographical origin. The Beijing genotype is strongly associated with multidrug resistance, and may have escaped from bacille Calmette–Gu erin-induced immunity. DNA fingerprinting has quantified the importance of institutional transmission and laboratory cross-contamination, and has helped to focus contact investigations. Questions to be answered in the near future with whole genome sequencing include identification of chains of transmission within clusters of patients, more precise quantification of mixed infection, and transmission probabilities and rates of progression from infection to disease of various M. tuberculosis lineages, as well as possible variations in vaccine efficacy by lineage. Perhaps most importantly, dynamics in the population structure of M. tuberculosis in response to control measures in high-prevalence areas should be better understood.},

abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the population. These results have important implications for the development of TB control strategies.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of directly observed treatment compared to conventional therapy in reducing the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, for an industrialised country (represented by the United States of America) and a developing country (South Africa). METHODS: Monte Carlo analysis using published data on probability, cost and health impact. RESULTS: In both countries, directly observed treatment is the dominant strategy, yielding cost savings and improved health outcomes. Cost savings for directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy become more significant as more expensive second-line drugs are used in treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy is demonstrated for both the USA and South Africa. Cost savings are more pronounced (especially for South Africa) as the likelihood of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis increases and more expensive second-line therapies are used. Given that health care resources are more severely constrained in developing countries, the data contained in this study are useful in guiding the design of policies for the effective management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in settings with limited resources.},

abstract = {The evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis presents several challenges for public health. HIV and resistance to antimycobacterial medications have evolutionary implications for how Mycobacterium tuberculosis will evolve, as these factors influence the host environment and transmission dynamics of tuberculosis strains. We present an evolutionary invasion analysis of tuberculosis that characterizes the direction of tuberculosis evolution in the context of different natural and human-driven selective pressures, including changes in tuberculosis treatment and HIV prevalence. We find that the evolution of tuberculosis virulence can be affected by treatment success rates, the relative transmissibility of emerging strains, the rate of reactivation from latency among hosts, and the life expectancy of hosts. We find that the virulence of tuberculosis strains may also increase as a consequence of rising HIV prevalence, requiring faster case detection strategies in areas where the epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis collide.},

abstract = {Mathematical models that describe the global spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and tuberculosis (TB) often consider a sample of international airports as a network supporting disease spread. However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.},

abstract = {The use of stochastic models to study the dynamics of infectious diseases is an important tool to understand the epidemiological process. For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate sigmabeta than infection rate beta). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered (SEIR{\_}{\{}I{\}}{\^{}}{\{}E{\}}) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. In future work, we also intend to investigate the effect of network topology on phase transitions when the SIRI model describes both transmitted diseases (sigma{\textless}1) and social contagions (sigma{\textgreater}1).},

abstract = {An important question, of whether the initiation of HIV treatment during ongoing TB treatment for HIV TB co-infected individuals is appropriate, still remains unanswered; initiating HIV treatment at or soon after the start of the TB treatment course has some advantages including fewer HIV-related deaths and a lower risk of HIV transmission as well as some disadvantages including occurrence of Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS) due to a high pill burden. In this study, we develop a mathematical model to explore the effects of early and late HIV treatment, during the TB treatment course, on new HIV infections, HIV-related deaths, and IRIS cases. Mathematical analyses of our model indicate that co-infection treatment programs alone cannot eradicate the diseases; additional interventions and/or treatments targeting individuals infected with a single disease are necessary for successful disease eradication. Numerical computations of the model solution demonstrate that outcomes of the treatment programs aiming to reduce the total burden of this co-infection depend highly on both the strength and initiation timing of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Based on our model, we also formulate an optimal control problem and solve it using Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and an efficient numerical iterative method. Our numerical results of an optimal HIV TB treatment protocol that yields a minimum burden from this co-infection indicates that each of the new HIV infections, HIV-related deaths and IRIS cases is important for achieving optimal benefits from the co-infection treatment programs.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multiple reconstructive procedures are common for the reconstruction of complex facial deformities of skin, soft tissues, bony structures, and functional subunits, such as the nose, lips, and eyelids. However, the results have been unsatisfactory. An innovative approach entailing a single surgical procedure of face allograft transplantation is a viable alternative and gives improved results. METHODS: On Dec 9, 2008, a 45-year-old woman with a history of severe midface trauma underwent near-total face transplantation in which 80{\%} of her face was replaced with a tailored composite tissue allograft. We addressed issues of immunosuppressive therapy, psychological and ethical outcomes, and re-integration of the patient into society. FINDINGS: After the operation, the patient did well physically and psychologically, and tolerated immunosuppression without any major complication. Routine biopsy on day 47 after transplantation showed rejection of graft mucosa; however, a single bolus of corticosteroids reversed rejection. During the first 3 weeks after transplantation, the patient accepted her new face; 6 months after surgery, the functional outcome has been excellent. In contrast to her status before transplantation, the patient can now breathe through her nose, smell, taste, speak intelligibly, eat solid foods, and drink from a cup. INTERPRETATION: We show the feasibility of reconstruction of severely disfigured patients in a single surgical procedure using composite face allotransplantation. Therefore, this should be taken in consideration as an early option for severely disfigured patients. FUNDING: None.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We explored host-related factors associated with the site of tuberculosis (TB) disease using variables routinely collected by the 31 EU/EEA countries for national surveillance., METHODS: Logistic regression models were fitted to case-based surveillance data reported to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control for TB cases notified from 2003 to 2014. Missing data on HIV infection and on susceptibility to isoniazid and rifampicin for many patients precluded the inclusion of these variables in the analysis. Records from Finland, Lithuania, Spain and the United Kingdom were excluded for lack of exact details of disease localisation; other records without one or more variable (e.g. previous treatment history, geographical origin) or who had mixed pulmonary and extrapulmonary disease or more than one form of extrapulmonary disease were also removed (total exclusion = 38{\%} of 913,637 notifications)., RESULTS: 564,916 TB cases reported by 27 EU/EEA countries had exclusive pulmonary (PTB; 83{\%}) or extrapulmonary (EPTB; 17{\%}) disease. EPTB was associated with age {\textless}15 years (aOR: 5.50), female sex (aOR: 1.60), no previous TB treatment (aOR: 3.10), and geographic origin (aOR range: 0.52-3.74). Origin from the Indian subcontinent or Africa was most strongly associated with lymphatic, osteo-articular and peritoneal/digestive localization (aOR{\textgreater}3.7), and age {\textless}15 years with lymphatic (aOR: 17.96) and central nervous system disease (aOR: 11.41)., CONCLUSIONS: Awareness of host-related determinants of site of TB is useful for diagnosis. The predilection for EPTB among patients originating from countries outside Europe may reflect strain preferences for disease localization, geographic/ethnic differences in disease manifestation and other factors, like HIV.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Long-term expatriates from low to high tuberculosis (TB) incidence countries get high rates of active TB and latent TB infection (LTBI). TB screening for expatriates is important for occupational health. Interferon-gamma release assays are more accurate than tuberculin skin test (TST). Rifapentine plus isoniazid for 3 months (3HP) is as effective as 9 months of isoniazid (9H) with a higher treatment-completion rate. METHODS: Decision trees and Markov models were constructed using a societal perspective on a lifetime horizon. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 30 year-old expatriates. Seven strategies; TST with 3HP or 9H, QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) with 3HP or 9H, T-SPOT(R).TB (TSPOT) with 3HP or 9H and chest X-ray examination (CXR) were modeled. The main outcome measure of effectiveness was quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) gained. RESULTS: QFT with 3HP yielded the greatest benefits with the lowest cost ({\$}US 674.8; 25.95660 QALYs [year 2012 values]). CXR was the least cost-effective ({\$}US 13,666.8; 24.62917 QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was sensitive to adherence rate of 3HP and QFT specificity, but not to BCG vaccination rate. CONCLUSIONS: Entry LTBI screening using QFT treated with 3HP is recommended on the basis of cost effectiveness among long-term expatriates from low to high incidence countries.},

abstract = {The availability of DNA fingerprinting techniques for Mycobacterium tuberculosis has led to attempts to estimate the extent of recent transmission in populations, using the assumption that groups of tuberculosis patients with identical isolates ("clusters") are likely to reflect recently acquired infections. It is never possible to include all cases of tuberculosis in a given population in a study, and the proportion of isolates found to be clustered will depend on the completeness of the sampling. Using stochastic simulation models based on real and hypothetical populations, the authors demonstrate the influence of incomplete sampling on the estimates of clustering obtained. The results show that as the sampling fraction increases, the proportion of isolates identified as clustered also increases and the variance of the estimated proportion clustered decreases. Cluster size is also important: the underestimation of clustering for any given sampling fraction is greater, and the variability in the results obtained is larger, for populations with small clusters than for those with the same number of individuals arranged in large clusters. A considerable amount of caution should be used in interpreting the results of studies on clustering of M. tuberculosis isolates, particularly when sampling fractions are small.},

This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.},

We aimed to produce a global mortality burden estimate in children using a complementary approach not dependent on vital registration data. METHODS: In this mathematical modelling study, we estimated deaths in children younger than 5 years and those aged 5-14 years for 217 countries and territories using a case-fatality-based approach. We used paediatric tuberculosis notification data and HIV and antiretroviral treatment estimates to disaggregate the WHO paediatric tuberculosis incidence estimates by age, HIV, and treatment status. We then applied systematic review evidence on corresponding case-fatality ratios. FINDINGS: We estimated that 239 000 (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI] 194 000-298 000) children younger than 15 years died from tuberculosis worldwide in 2015; 80{\%} (191 000, 95{\%} UI 132 000-257 000) of these deaths were in children younger than 5 years. More than 70{\%} (182 000, 140 000-239 000) of deaths occurred in the WHO southeast Asia and Africa regions. We estimated that 39 000 (17{\%}, 23 000-73 000) paediatric tuberculosis deaths worldwide were in children with HIV infections, with 31 000 (36{\%}, 19 000-59 000) in the WHO Africa region. More than 96{\%} (230 000, 185 000-289 000) of all tuberculosis deaths occurred in children not receiving tuberculosis treatment. INTERPRETATION: Tuberculosis is a top ten cause of death in children worldwide and a key omission from previous analyses of under-5 mortality. Almost all these deaths occur in children not on tuberculosis treatment, implying substantial scope to reduce this burden.

abstract = {UNLABELLED: Infection risk assessment is very useful in understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases and in predicting the risk of these diseases to the public. Quantitative infection risk assessment can provide quantitative analysis of disease transmission and the effectiveness of infection control measures. The Wells-Riley model has been extensively used for quantitative infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases in indoor premises. Some newer studies have also proposed the use of dose-response models for such purpose. This study reviews and compares these two approaches to infection risk assessment of respiratory infectious diseases. The Wells-Riley model allows quick assessment and does not require interspecies extrapolation of infectivity. Dose-response models can consider other disease transmission routes in addition to airborne route and can calculate the infectious source strength of an outbreak in terms of the quantity of the pathogen rather than a hypothetical unit. Spatial distribution of airborne pathogens is one of the most important factors in infection risk assessment of respiratory disease. Respiratory deposition of aerosol induces heterogeneous infectivity of intake pathogens and randomness on the intake dose, which are not being well accounted for in current risk models. Some suggestions for further development of the risk assessment models are proposed. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: This review article summarizes the strengths and limitations of the Wells-Riley and the dose-response models for risk assessment of respiratory diseases. Even with many efforts by various investigators to develop and modify the risk assessment models, some limitations still persist. This review serves as a reference for further development of infection risk assessment models of respiratory diseases. The Wells-Riley model and dose-response model offer specific advantages. Risk assessors can select the approach that is suitable to their particular conditions to perform risk assessment.},

We then present new analytical results, and show how these results can be used: (i) to predict the epidemiological outcomes of epidemic control strategies an (ii) to design epidemic control strategies. We also include two new factors in our epidemic control models (reinfection and treatment delay); we discuss the epidemiological consequences of these two factors in the design of control strategies. Finally, we conclude with a brief discussion of the implications of our theoretical results for tuberculosis control in light of recently reported results from the WHO's Global Project on Anti-tuberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Use of Xpert MTB/RIF is being scaled up throughout South Africa for improved diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB). A large proportion of HIV-infected patients with possible TB are Xpert-negative on their initial test, and the existing diagnostic algorithm calls for these patients to have sputum culture (Xpert followed by culture (X/C)). We modelled the costs and impact of an alternative diagnostic algorithm in which these cultures are replaced with a second Xpert test (Xpert followed by Xpert (X/X)). METHODS: An existing population-level decision model was used. Costs were estimated from Xpert implementation studies and public sector price and salary data. The number of patients requiring diagnosis was estimated from the literature, as were rates of TB treatment uptake and loss to follow-up. TB and HIV positivity rates were estimated from the national TB register and laboratory databases. RESULTS: At national programme scale in 2014, X/X (R969 million/year) is less expensive than X/C R1 095 million/year), potentially saving R126 million/year (US{\$}17.4 million). However, because Xpert is less sensitive than culture, X/X diagnoses 2{\%} fewer TB cases. This is partly offset by higher expected treatment uptake with X/X due to the faster availability of results, resulting in 1{\%} more patients initiating treatment under X/X than X/C. The cost per TB patient initiated on treatment under X/X is R2 682, which is 12{\%} less than under X/C (R3 046). CONCLUSIONS: Modifying the diagnostic algorithm from X/C to X/X could provide rapid results, simplify diagnostic processes, improve HIV/TB treatment outcomes, and generate cost savings.},

abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as trans-mission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in par-ameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and com-putationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the stan-dard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in esti-mates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impact of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on long-term population-level tuberculosis disease (TB) incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: We used a mathematical model to consider the effect of different assumptions about life expectancy and TB risk during long-term ART under alternative scenarios for trends in population HIV incidence and ART coverage. RESULTS: All the scenarios we explored predicted that the widespread introduction of ART would initially reduce population-level TB incidence. However, many modelled scenarios projected a rebound in population-level TB incidence after around 20 years. This rebound was predicted to exceed the TB incidence present before ART scale-up if decreases in HIV incidence during the same period were not sufficiently rapid or if the protective effect of ART on TB was not sustained. Nevertheless, most scenarios predicted a reduction in the cumulative TB incidence when accompanied by a relative decline in HIV incidence of more than 10{\%} each year. CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-term benefits of ART scale-up on population TB incidence in sub-Saharan Africa, longer-term projections raise the possibility of a rebound in TB incidence. This highlights the importance of sustaining good adherence and immunologic response to ART and, crucially, the need for effective HIV preventive interventions, including early widespread implementation of ART.},

The exact etiology of feline infectious peritonitis and its connection to coronavirus is unclear, with two competing theories - mutation process vs multiple virus strains. We apply the model to each of these theories, showing that in either case, one should expect traditional threshold dynamics.

abstract = {The emergence of highly drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) and interactions between TB and HIV epidemics pose serious challenges for TB control. Previous researchers have presented several hypotheses for why HIV-coinfected TB patients may suffer an increased risk of drug-resistant TB (DRTB) compared to other TB patients. Although some studies have found a positive association between an individual's HIV status and his or her subsequent risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDRTB), the observed individual-level relationship between HIV and DRTB varies substantially among settings. Here, we develop a modeling framework to explore the effect of HIV on the dynamics of DRTB. The model captures the acquisition of resistance to important classes of TB drugs, imposes fitness costs associated with resistance-conferring mutations, and allows for subsequent restoration of fitness because of compensatory mutations. Despite uncertainty in several key parameters, we demonstrate epidemic behavior that is robust over a range of assumptions. Whereas HIV facilitates the emergence of MDRTB within a community over several decades, HIV-seropositive individuals presenting with TB may, counterintuitively, be at lower risk of drug-resistant TB at early stages of the co-epidemic. This situation arises because many individuals with incident HIV infection will already harbor latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection acquired at an earlier time when drug resistance was less prevalent. We find that the rise of HIV can increase the prevalence of MDRTB within populations even as it lowers the average fitness of circulating MDRTB strains compared to similar populations unaffected by HIV. Preferential social mixing among individuals with similar HIV status and lower average CD4 counts among HIV-seropositive individuals further increase the expected burden of MDRTB. This model suggests that the individual-level association between HIV and drug-resistant forms of TB is dynamic, and therefore, cross-sectional studies that do not report a positive individual-level association will not provide assurance that HIV does not exacerbate the burden of resistant TB in the community.},

Two sub-models, namely: malaria-only and TB-only sub-models are considered first of all. Sufficient conditions for the local stability of the steady states are presented. Global stability of the disease-free steady state does not hold because the two sub-models exhibit backward bifurcation. The dynamics of the dual malaria-TB only sub-model is also analyzed. It has different dynamics to that of malaria-only and TB-only sub-models: the dual malaria-TB only model has no positive endemic equilibrium whenever R(MT)(d) {\textless} 1, - its disease free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable whenever the reproduction number for dual malaria-TB co-infection only R(MT)(d) {\textless} 1 - it does not exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation. Graphical representations of this phenomenon is shown, while numerical simulations of the full model are carried out in order to determine whether the two diseases will co-exist whenever their partial reproductive numbers exceed unity. Finally, we perform sensitivity analysis on the key parameters that drive the disease dynamics in order to determine their relative importance to disease transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The prognosis, specifically the case fatality and duration, of untreated tuberculosis is important as many patients are not correctly diagnosed and therefore receive inadequate or no treatment. Furthermore, duration and case fatality of tuberculosis are key parameters in interpreting epidemiological data. METHODOLOGY AND PRINCIPAL FINDINGS To estimate the duration and case fatality of untreated pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV negative patients we reviewed studies from the pre-chemotherapy era. Untreated smear-positive tuberculosis among HIV negative individuals has a 10-year case fatality variously reported between 53{\%} and 86{\%}, with a weighted mean of 70{\%}. Ten-year case fatality of culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis was nowhere reported directly but can be indirectly estimated to be approximately 20{\%}. The duration of tuberculosis from onset to cure or death is approximately 3 years and appears to be similar for smear-positive and smear-negative tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS Current models of untreated tuberculosis that assume a total duration of 2 years until self-cure or death underestimate the duration of disease by about one year, but their case fatality estimates of 70{\%} for smear-positive and 20{\%} for culture-positive smear-negative tuberculosis appear to be satisfactory.},

abstract = {Recurrent episodes of tuberculosis (TB) can be due to relapse of latent infection or exogenous reinfection, and discrimination is crucial for control planning. Molecular genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates offers concrete opportunities to measure the relative contribution of reinfection in recurrent disease. Here, a mathematical model of TB transmission is fitted to data from 14 molecular epidemiology studies, enabling the estimation of relevant epidemiological parameters. Meta-analysis reveals that rates of reinfection after successful treatment are higher than rates of new TB, raising an important question about the underlying mechanism. We formulate two alternative mechanisms within our model framework: (i) infection increases susceptibility to reinfection or (ii) infection affects individuals differentially, thereby recruiting high-risk individuals to the group at risk for reinfection. The second mechanism is better supported by the fittings to the data, suggesting that reinfection rates are inflated through a population phenomenon that occurs in the presence of heterogeneity in individual risk of infection. As a result, rates of reinfection are higher when measured at the population level even though they might be lower at the individual level. Finally, differential host recruitment is modulated by transmission intensity, being less pronounced when incidence is high.},

abstract = {Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis. In this work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis. The results of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective.},

We compared the completion rates, number of adverse effects, and cost effectiveness of these two regimens. Patients were treated at the San Francisco Tuberculosis Clinic from 1993 through 1996. A Markov model was developed to assess impact on life expectancy and costs. One thousand twenty-two patients, with a mean age of 52 yr, and {\textgreater} 90{\%} foreign born, were treated; 545 received isoniazid and 477 received isoniazid and rifampin.

Both regimens increased life expectancy by 1.4-1.5 yr. Compared with isoniazid, isoniazid and rifampin produced net incremental savings of {\$}135 per patient treated. In patients with radiographic evidence of prior tuberculosis who have not been previously treated, isoniazid for 12 mo and isoniazid and rifampin for 4 mo have similar rates of completion and adverse effects, and both increase life expectancy compared with no treatment. Isoniazid and rifampin for 4 mo is cost saving compared with isoniazid alone. This advantage was maintained even when compared with 9 mo of isoniazid, the new American Thoracic Society/Centers for Disease Control (ATS/CDC) recommendation for treatment with isoniazid alone.},

abstract = {This study illustrates how cost-effectiveness calculations provide help in decisions involving a choice between introduction of a new diagnostic procedure or a new therapy for a particular clinical problem. This type of problem is critical for areas where financial resources are limiting. Our analysis is centered on the value of diagnosis and treatment in tuberculous meningitis (Tbm) and, because of its importance to developing countries, our epidemiologic data were derived from India. When financial costs are ignored, the introduction of second line therapy (e.g., Rifampin) leads to more cures than does the introduction of even a perfect diagnostic test. However, diagnostic tests (e.g., the Bromide partition test or possibly radioassays) markedly improve case finding and to some extent increase cure rates. All affects vary markedly with the prevalence of tuberculous meningitis in the population under study. For example, net financial savings would occur were a perfect nuclear test available and conventional therapy used at a prevalence of Tbm of 30{\%} whereas there would be a net loss if the prevalence rose to 80{\%}. This study underscores the need for detailed studies on the radiobromide partition test and for the development of new diagnostic tests, perhaps a radioimmunoassay of either the acid fast bacillus or of an antibody to it.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Canada, active tuberculosis (TB) disease rates remain disproportionately higher among the Indigenous population, especially among the Inuit in the north. We used mathematical modeling to evaluate how interventions might enhance existing TB control efforts in a region of Nunavut. METHODS: We developed a stochastic, agent-based model of TB transmission that captured the unique household and community structure. Evaluated interventions included: (i) rapid treatment of active cases; (ii) rapid contact tracing; (iii) expanded screening programs for latent TB infection (LTBI); and (iv) reduced household density. The outcomes of interest were incident TB infections and total diagnosed active TB disease over a 10- year time period. RESULTS: Model-projected incidence in the absence of additional interventions was highly variable (range: 33-369 cases) over 10 years. Compared to the 'no additional intervention' scenario, reducing the time between onset of active TB disease and initiation of treatment reduced both the number of new TB infections (47{\%} reduction, relative risk of TB = 0.53) and diagnoses of active TB disease (19{\%} reduction, relative risk of TB = 0.81). Expanding general population screening was also projected to reduce the burden of TB, although these findings were sensitive to assumptions around the relative amount of transmission occurring outside of households. Other potential interventions examined in the model (school-based screening, rapid contact tracing, and reduced household density) were found to have limited effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: In a region of northern Canada experiencing a significant TB burden, more rapid treatment initiation in active TB cases was the most impactful intervention evaluated. Mathematical modeling can provide guidance for allocation of limited resources in a way that minimizes disease transmission and protects population health.},

In the model, we have divided the population into four sub classes of susceptibles, TB infectives, HIV infectives and that of AIDS patients. The model exhibits four equillibria namely, a disease free, HIV free, TB free and a co?infection equilibrium. The model has been studied qualitatively using stability theory of nonlinear differential equations. It is shown that the positive co?infection equilibrium is always locally stable but it may become globally stable under certain conditions showing that the disease becomes endemic due to constant migration of the population into the habitat. A numerical study of the model is also performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters on the spread of the disease.},

Furthermore, E. coli of animal origin may act as a donor of antimicrobial resistance genes for other pathogenic E. coli. Thus, the intensive use of antimicrobial agents in food animals may add to the burden of antimicrobial resistance in humans. Bacteria from the animal reservoir that carry resistance to antimicrobial agents that are regarded as highly or critically important in human therapy (e.g., aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, and third- and fourth-generation cephalosporins) are of especially great concern.},

abstract = {Despite global reductions in HIV incidence and mortality, the 15 UNAIDS-designated countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia (EECA) that gained independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 constitute the only region where both continue to rise. HIV transmission in EECA is fuelled primarily by injection of opioids, with harsh criminalisation of drug use that has resulted in extraordinarily high levels of incarceration. Consequently, people who inject drugs, including those with HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis, are concentrated within prisons. Evidence-based primary and secondary prevention of HIV using opioid agonist therapies such as methadone and buprenorphine is available in prisons in only a handful of EECA countries (methadone or buprenorphine in fi ve countries and needle and syringe programmes in three countries), with none of them meeting recommended coverage levels. Similarly, antiretroviral therapy coverage, especially among people who inject drugs, is markedly under-scaled. Russia completely bans opioid agonist therapies and does not support needle and syringe programmes—with neither available in prisons—despite the country's high incarceration rate and having the largest burden of people with HIV who inject drugs in the region. Mathematical modelling for Ukraine suggests that high levels of incarceration in EECA countries facilitate HIV transmission among people who inject drugs, with 28–55{\%} of all new HIV infections over the next 15 years predicted to be attributable to heightened HIV transmission risk among currently or previously incarcerated people who inject drugs. Scaling up of opioid agonist therapies within prisons and maintaining treatment after release would yield the greatest HIV transmission reduction in people who inject drugs. Additional analyses also suggest that at least 6{\%} of all incident tuberculosis cases, and 75{\%} of incident tuberculosis cases in people who inject drugs are due to incarceration. Interventions that reduce incarceration itself and eff ectively intervene with prisoners to screen, diagnose, and treat addiction and HIV, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis are urgently needed to stem the multiple overlapping epidemics concentrated in prisons.},

This is reflected in differences in the structures of mathematical models of TB, which in turn produce differences in the predicted impacts of interventions. Gaining a greater understanding of TB transmission dynamics requires further empirical laboratory and field work, mathematical modelling and interaction between them. Modelling can be used to quantify uncertainty due to different gaps in our knowledge to help identify research priorities. Fortunately, the present moment is an exciting time for TB epidemiology, with rapid progress being made in applying new mathematical modelling techniques, new tools for TB diagnosis and genetic analysis and a growing interest in developing more-effective public-health interventions.},

abstract = {Highly non-linear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly non-linear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods, in order to reach conclusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model mis-specification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem but, under the correct model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.},

In contrast, we calculate that transmission of resistance is currently low, and predict it will remain low. We show that the epidemic of resistance is being generated mainly by the conversion of drug-sensitive cases to drug-resistant cases, and not by the transmission of resistant strains. We also show that transmission of resistant strains has not increased the overall number of new HIV infections.

abstract = {Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR TB) has been detected in most provinces of South Africa, particularly in the KwaZulu-Natal province where several hundred cases have been reported since 2004. We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although tuberculosis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide, available funding falls far short of that required for effective control. Economic and spillover consequences of investments in the treatment of tuberculosis are unclear, particularly when steep gradients in the disease and response are linked by population movements, such as that between Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Australian cross-border region. OBJECTIVE: To undertake an economic evaluation of Australian support for the expansion of basic Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course in the PNG border area of the South Fly from the current level of 14{\%} coverage. METHODS: Both cost-utility analysis and cost-benefit analysis were applied to models that allow for population movement across regions with different characteristics of tuberculosis burden, transmission, and access to treatment. Cost-benefit data were drawn primarily from estimates published by the World Health Organization, and disease transmission data were drawn from a previously published model. RESULTS: Investing {\$}16 million to increase basic Directly Observed Treatment, Short Course coverage in the South Fly generates a net present value of roughly {\$}74 million for Australia (discounted 2005 dollars). The cost per disability-adjusted life-year averted and quality-adjusted life-year saved for PNG is {\$}7 and {\$}4.6, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Where regions with major disparities in tuberculosis burden and health system resourcing are connected through population movements, investments in tuberculosis control are of mutual benefit, resulting in net health and economic gains on both sides of the border. These findings are likely to inform the case for appropriate investment in tuberculosis control globally.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite improvements in treatment success rates for tuberculosis (TB), current six-month regimen duration remains a challenge for many National TB Programmes, health systems, and patients. There is increasing investment in the development of shortened regimens with a number of candidates in phase 3 trials. METHODS: We developed an individual-based decision analytic model to assess the cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical four-month regimen for first-line treatment of TB, assuming non-inferiority to current regimens of six-month duration. The model was populated using extensive, empirically-collected data to estimate the economic impact on both health systems and patients of regimen shortening for first-line TB treatment in South Africa, Brazil, Bangladesh, and Tanzania. We explicitly considered 'real world' constraints such as sub-optimal guideline adherence. RESULTS: From a societal perspective, a shortened regimen, priced at USD1 per day, could be a cost-saving option in South Africa, Brazil, and Tanzania, but would not be cost-effective in Bangladesh when compared to one gross domestic product (GDP) per capita. Incorporating 'real world' constraints reduces cost-effectiveness. Patient-incurred costs could be reduced in all settings. From a health service perspective, increased drug costs need to be balanced against decreased delivery costs. The new regimen would remain a cost-effective option, when compared to each countries' GDP per capita, even if new drugs cost up to USD7.5 and USD53.8 per day in South Africa and Brazil; this threshold was above USD1 in Tanzania and under USD1 in Bangladesh. CONCLUSION: Reducing the duration of first-line TB treatment has the potential for substantial economic gains from a patient perspective. The potential economic gains for health services may also be important, but will be context-specific and dependent on the appropriate pricing of any new regimen.},

Outside this region the particle is unstable against decay into three BPS states carrying the same total charge as the original state.

abstract = {Models for the transmission dynamics of mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) that incorporate exogenous re-infection are known to induce the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, a dynamic phenomenon associated with the existence of two stable attractors when the reproduction number of the model is less than unity. This study shows, by way of a counter example, that exogenous re-infection does not always cause backward bifurcation in TB transmission dynamics. In particular, it is shown that it is the transmission ability of the re-infected individuals, and not just the re-infection process, that causes the backward bifurcation phenomenon. When re-infected individuals do not transmit infection, the disease-free equilibrium of the model is shown to be globally-asymptotically stable (GAS) when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever the reproduction threshold exceeds unity. It is shown, using a Lyapunov function, that the unique endemic equilibrium is GAS for the special case with no disease-induced mortality and no transmission by re-infected individuals. It is further shown that even if re-infected individuals do transmit infection, backward bifurcation only occurs if their transmissibility exceeds a certain threshold. Sensitivity analyses, with respect to the derived backward bifurcation threshold, show that the phenomenon of backward bifurcation is more likely to occur if the rates of re-infection and transmissibility of re-infected individuals are sufficiently high. Furthermore, it is likely to occur if the fraction of slow progressors (to active TB) is increased or if the rates of treatment (of symptomatic cases) and disease-induced mortality are increased. On the other hand, backward bifurcation is less likely to occur for increasing rates of endogenous re-activation of latent TB cases.},

@article{Vynnycky1997a,
abstract = {Many aspects of the natural history of tuberculosis are poorly understood. Though it is recognized that clinical tuberculosis may follow shortly after initial infection ('primary' disease), or many years thereafter through either endogenous reactivation or after reinfection, the relative importance of these mechanisms is often disputed. The issue is complicated by the fact that the risks of developing disease are age-dependent, and reflect infection risks which may change over time. This paper estimates the age-dependent risks of developing tuberculosis using an age-structured deterministic model of the dynamics of tuberculous infection and disease in England and Wales since 1900. The work extends the classical studies of Sutherland and colleagues. The best estimates of the risks of developing 'primary' disease (within 5 years of initial infection) were approximately 4{\%}, 9{\%} and 14{\%} for individuals infected at ages 0-10, 15 years and over 20 years respectively, and a previous infection appeared to impart little protection against (further) reinfection, but 16-41{\%} protection against disease subsequent to reinfection for adolescents and adults. We also provide evidence that reinfection made an important contribution to tuberculous morbidity in the past, as (i) exclusion of exogenous disease from the model considerably worsened the fit to observed notification rates, and (ii) the dramatic decline in the risk of tuberculous infection from 1950 in England and Wales accelerated the decline in morbidity among all individuals, even among the older age groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection. We conclude that the risk of infection is the single most important factor affecting the magnitude of the tuberculous morbidity in a population, as it determines both the age pattern of initial infection (and hence the risk of developing disease) and the risk of reinfection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite consistently meeting international performance targets for tuberculosis case detection and treatment success, areas where tuberculosis is hyperendemic fail to achieve the predicted epidemiological impact. In this article, we explore the anomalous relationship between defined performance targets and actual reduction in tuberculosis transmission. METHODS: In areas where tuberculosis is endemic, poorly ventilated social gathering places such as shebeens (informal alcohol drinking places), minibus taxis, and clinic waiting rooms are all potential transmission hot spots. We modeled the transmission reduction achieved by removal of infectious persons in settings with different tuberculosis prevalence rates to demonstrate the concept of transmission elasticity. We then applied this concept to real-life data from a hyperendemic community in Cape Town, South Africa. RESULTS: In a hyperendemic area, reducing the number of infectious people by a given percentage results in a smaller percentage decrease in the annual risk of infection (ARI) compared with a nonendemic area; for example, removing 10{\%} of infectious persons could result in as little as a 5{\%} reduction in the ARI. With use of real-life data and removal of 60{\%} of infectious individuals with tuberculosis, as would be achieved by meeting current performance targets of 70{\%} case detection and 85{\%} cure, the estimated ARI reduction is 50{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: The relationship between the number of infectious people removed and the decrease in ARI is nonlinear. The concept of transmission elasticity has important implications for the formulation of universal performance targets, since hyperendemic areas would require more stringent targets to achieve comparable transmission reduction.},

DESIGN: Modelling based on country-level programme and epidemiological data from 1997 to 2006. RESULTS: The scale-up of TB control in India has resulted in a total health benefit of 29.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), including 1.3 million deaths averted. In 2006, the burden of TB measured in terms of DALYs lost would have been 1.8 times higher in the absence of the programme. The total gain in economic well-being from TB control is estimated at US{\$}88.1 billion over the 1997-2006 10-year period. Total public expenditure on TB control over this period amounted to US{\$}768 million, with the RNTCP accounting for US{\$}299 million and other health sector costs accounting for US{\$}469 million. The cost of TB control averaged just US{\$}26 per DALY gained over 1997-2006 and generated a return of US{\$}115 per dollar spent.

abstract = {Background In 2013, approximately 480,000 people developed active multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), while only 97,000 started MDR-TB treatment. We sought to estimate the impact of improving access to MDR-TB diagnosis and treatment, under multiple diagnostic algorithm and treatment regimen scenarios, on ten-year projections of MDR-TB incidence and mortality. Methods We constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR-TB epidemic in an illustrative East/Southeast Asian setting. Using approximate Bayesian computation, we investigated a wide array of potential epidemic trajectories consistent with current notification data and known TB epidemiology. Results Despite an overall projected decline in TB incidence, data-consistent simulations suggested that MDR-TB incidence is likely to rise between 2015 and 2025 under continued 2013 treatment practices, although with considerable uncertainty (median 17{\%} increase, 95{\%} Uncertainty Range [UR] -38{\%} to + 137{\%}). But if, by 2017, all identified active TB patients with previously-treated TB could be tested for drug susceptibility, and 85{\%} of those with MDR-TB could initiate MDR-appropriate treatment, then MDR-TB incidence in 2025 could be reduced by 26{\%} (95{\%} UR 4-52{\%}) relative to projections under continued current practice. Also expanding this drug-susceptibility testing and appropriate MDR-TB treatment to treatment-naive as well as previously-treated TB cases, by 2020, could reduce MDR-TB incidence in 2025 by 29{\%} (95{\%} UR 6-55{\%}) compared to continued current practice. If this diagnosis and treatment of all MDR-TB in known active TB cases by 2020 could be implemented via a novel second-line regimen with similar effectiveness and tolerability as current first-line therapy, a 54{\%} (95{\%} UR 20-74{\%}) reduction in MDR-TB incidence compared to current-practice projections could be achieved by 2025. Conclusions Expansion of diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, even using current sub-optimal second-line regimens, is expected to significantly decrease MDR-TB incidence at the population level. Focusing MDR diagnostic efforts on previously-treated cases is an efficient first-step approach.},

abstract = {The treatment of bacterial infections is increasingly complicated by the ability of bacteria to develop resistance to antimicrobial agents. Antimicrobial agents are often categorized according to their principal mechanism of action. Mechanisms include interference with cell wall synthesis (e.g., ??-lactams and glycopeptide agents), inhibition of protein synthesis (macrolides and tetracyclines), interference with nucleic acid synthesis (fluoroquinolones and rifampin), inhibition of a metabolic pathway (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole), and disruption of bacterial membrane structure (polymyxins and daptomycin). Bacteria may be intrinsically resistant to ???1 class of antimicrobial agents, or may acquire resistance by de novo mutation or via the acquisition of resistance genes from other organisms. Acquired resistance genes may enable a bacterium to produce enzymes that destroy the antibacterial drug, to express efflux systems that prevent the drug from reaching its intracellular target, to modify the drug's target site, or to produce an alternative metabolic pathway that bypasses the action of the drug. Acquisition of new genetic material by antimicrobial-susceptible bacteria from resistant strains of bacteria may occur through conjugation, transformation, or transduction, with transposons often facilitating the incorporation of the multiple resistance genes into the host's genome or plasmids. Use of antibacterial agents creates selective pressure for the emergence of resistant strains. Herein 3 case histories-one involving Escherichia coli resistance to third-generation cephalosporins, another focusing on the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and a third detailing multidrug resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa-are reviewed to illustrate the varied ways in which resistant bacteria develop. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to simulate rates of tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (NTM), and to examine the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per case averted of three different strategies: universal BCG, selective BCG (10{\%} of infants at higher TB risk than other infants) or no BCG immunization. RESULTS: In a cohort of 60,000 infants over 15 years, the model predicts five cases each of TB and NTM disease with universal immunization, 8-21 TB and 31 NTM cases with various strategies of selective immunization, and 25 TB and 34 NTM cases with no BCG immunization. BCG side-effects are predicted in 5, 0.5 and 0 infants, respectively. The cost per case averted for immunization strategies ranges from a cost of 38,311 US dollars to a savings of 323 dollars as selective immunization becomes more efficient at targeting infants at highest risk of TB. CONCLUSIONS: In a country with a low incidence of pediatric tuberculosis, selective BCG immunization is a more cost-effective strategy than universal BCG immunization for the prevention of tuberculosis, but results in an increase in NTM cases.},

abstract = {A recent major cluster randomized trial of screening, active disease treatment, and mass isoniazid preventive therapy for 9 months during 2006-2011 among South African gold miners showed reduced individual-level tuberculosis incidence but no detectable population-level impact. We fitted a dynamic mathematical model to trial data and explored 1) factors contributing to the lack of population-level impact, 2) the best-achievable impact if all implementation characteristics were increased to the highest level achieved during the trial ("optimized intervention"), and 3) how tuberculosis might be better controlled with additional interventions (improving diagnostics, reducing treatment delay, providing isoniazid preventive therapy continuously to human immunodeficiency virus-positive people, or scaling up antiretroviral treatment coverage) individually and in combination. We found the following: 1) The model suggests that a small proportion of latent infections among human immunodeficiency virus-positive people were cured, which could have been a key factor explaining the lack of detectable population-level impact. 2) The optimized implementation increased impact by only 10{\%}. 3) Implementing additional interventions individually and in combination led to up to 30{\%} and 75{\%} reductions, respectively, in tuberculosis incidence after 10 years. Tuberculosis control requires a combination prevention approach, including health systems strengthening to minimize treatment delay, improving diagnostics, increased antiretroviral treatment coverage, and effective preventive treatment regimens.},

abstract = {In the study of complex patterns in biology, mathematical and computational models are emerging as important tools. In addition to experimental approaches, these modeling tools have recently been applied to address open questions regarding host-pathogen interaction dynamics, including the immune response to mycobacterial infection and tuberculous granuloma formation. We present an approach in which a computational model represents the interaction of the Mycobacterium infection with the innate immune system in zebrafish at a high level of abstraction. We use the Petri Net formalism to model the interaction between the key host elements involved in granuloma formation and infection dissemination. We define a qualitative model for the understanding and description of causal relations in this dynamic process. Complex processes involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communication can be modeled at smaller scales and incorporated hierarchically into this main model; these are to be included in later elaborations. With the infection mechanism being defined on a higher level, lower-level processes influencing the host-pathogen interaction can be identified, modeled, and tested both quantitatively and qualitatively. This systems biology framework incorporates modeling to generate and test hypotheses, to perform virtual experiments, and to make experimentally verifiable predictions. Thereby it supports the unraveling of the mechanisms of tuberculosis infection.},

The R package pomp provides a very flexible framework for Monte Carlo statistical investigations using nonlinear, non-Gaussian POMP models. A range of modern statistical methods for POMP models have been implemented in this framework including sequential Monte Carlo, iterated filtering, particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, approximate Bayesian computation, maximum synthetic likelihood estimation, nonlinear forecasting, and trajectory matching. In this paper, we demonstrate the application of these methodologies using some simple toy problems. We also illustrate the specification of more complex POMP models, using a nonlinear epidemiological model with a discrete population, seasonality, and extra-demographic stochasticity. We discuss the specification of user-defined models and the development of additional methods within the programming environment provided by pomp.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether short-term annual declines of 5-10{\%} in the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) can be sustained over the long term by maintaining high case detection rates (CDRs). METHODS: We constructed a compartmental difference-equation model of a TB epidemic in a hypothetical population of constant size with a treatment success rate of 85{\%}. The impact of CDR on TB incidence was then investigated by generating an equilibrium population with no TB case detection and increasing the smear-positive CDR under two scenarios: (i) rapid expansion by 10{\%} per year to a CDR of 80{\%} after 8 years, and (ii) gradual expansion by 1{\%} per year to a CDR of 90{\%} after 90 years. The model was applied in two hypothetical populations: one without HIV and the other with a stable HIV incidence representative of the African Region. The CDR for smear-negative TB was assumed to be a constant fraction of the smear-positive CDR. FINDINGS: In the absence of a TB control programme, the projected annual incidence of TB was 513 cases per 100 000 population, with a point prevalence of 1233 per 100 000 and an annual TB-specific mortality rate of 182 per 100 000. Immediately increasing the TB CDR from 0{\%} to 70{\%} caused a 74{\%} reduction in TB incidence within 10 years. However, once case detection stabilized at any constant level {\textless} 80{\%}, projected TB incidence also stabilized. Ten years after a CDR of 70{\%} was reached, the annual decline in TB incidence was {\textless} 1.5{\%}, regardless of how rapidly case detection was scaled up and despite wide variation of all model parameters. CONCLUSION: While improved CDRs have a dramatic short-term effect on TB incidence, maintaining those rates, even at current target levels, may not reduce long-term incidence by more than 1-2{\%} per year. TB control programmes and researchers should vigorously pursue improvements in case detection, regardless of current CDRs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In high incidence settings, the majority of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) transmission occurs outside the household. Little is known about where people's indoor contacts occur outside the household, and how this differs between different settings. We estimate the number of contact hours that occur between adults and adult/youths and children in different building types in urban areas in Western Cape, South Africa, and Zambia. METHODS: Data were collected from 3206 adults using a cross-sectional survey, on buildings visited in a 24-h period, including building function, visit duration, and number of adults/youths and children (5-12 years) present. The mean numbers of contact hours per day by building function were calculated. RESULTS: Adults in Western Cape were more likely to visit workplaces, and less likely to visit shops and churches than adults in Zambia. Adults in Western Cape spent longer per visit in other homes and workplaces than adults in Zambia. More adults/youths were present at visits to shops and churches in Western Cape than in Zambia, and fewer at homes and hairdressers. More children were present at visits to shops in Western Cape than in Zambia, and fewer at schools and hairdressers. Overall numbers of adult/youth indoor contact hours were the same at both sites (35.4 and 37.6 h in Western Cape and Zambia respectively, p = 0.4). Child contact hours were higher in Zambia (16.0 vs 13.7 h, p = 0.03). Adult/youth and child contact hours were highest in workplaces in Western Cape and churches in Zambia. Compared to Zambia, adult contact hours in Western Cape were higher in workplaces (15.2 vs 8.0 h, p = 0.004), and lower in churches (3.7 vs 8.6 h, p = 0.002). Child contact hours were higher in other peoples' homes (2.8 vs 1.6 h, p = 0.03) and workplaces (4.9 vs 2.1 h, p = 0.003), and lower in churches (2.5 vs 6.2, p = 0.004) and schools (0.4 vs 1.5, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patterns of indoor contact between adults and adults/youths and children differ between different sites in high M.tb incidence areas. Targeting public buildings with interventions to reduce M.tb transmission (e.g. increasing ventilation or UV irradiation) should be informed by local data.},

abstract = {This paper presents mathematical models for tuberculosis and its dynamics under the implementation of the direct observation therapy strategy (DOTS) in Nigeria. The models establish conditions for the eradication of tuberculosis in Nigeria based on the fraction of detected infectious individuals placed under DOTS for treatment. Both numerical and qualitative analysis of the models were carried out and the effect of the fraction of detected cases of active TB on the various epidemiological classes is investigated. The results showed that, provided that the fraction of detected infectious individuals exceeded a critical value, there exists a globally stable disease free equilibrium. However, if this critical detection level is not reached, the disease-free equilibrium will be unstable even with the very high probability successful treatment under DOTS. The results showed that DOTS expansion in Nigeria must include significant increase in the detection rate of infectious individuals; otherwise the effect in reducing the incidence in Nigeria will not be achieved disregarding the tremendous efforts in any other direction, and the huge number of undetected cases will make DOTS insignificant with respect to tuberculosis control.},

abstract = {We assessed the direct and indirect economic costs and benefits of the current policy of revaccinating tuberculin-negative schoolchildren in the Czech Republic. The analysis is conducted from the perspective of the payer for health care. In considering whether revaccination should be discontinued, we consistently made assumptions which tend to favor revaccination. The direct costs of revaccination are estimated at Czech Koruna (KCR) 15.0 million (US{\$}0.46 million) annually. The direct benefits are the treatment costs saved for future cases averted by revaccination. These range from KCR 0.5 million (US{\$}0.015 million, ambulatory care, excluding transmission benefits) to KCR 13.7 million (US{\$}0.4 million, hospitalization, including transmission benefits). Costs exceed benefits even if children are revaccinated without prior tuberculin testing. The major indirect cost is the loss of work output attributable to tuberculosis morbidity. Counting the averted loss in output as a benefit does not change the results qualitatively, although there is a 50{\%} chance that the benefits will be greater than costs if treatment continues to be hospital-based. Thus, the costs of revaccination in the Czech Republic are found to exceed benefits over most, plausible variations in parameter values. The cost-benefit ratio is especially large if patients are given ambulatory treatment, as recommended by the World Health Organization.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In HIV-uninfected individuals, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) has been associated with long-term protection against tuberculosis (TB). For HIV-infected/antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive individuals, high TB rates have been observed following completion of IPT, consistent with a lack of 'cure' of infection. Recent trial data of IPT among HIV-infected individuals on ART in Khayelitsha, South Africa, have suggested that the effect of IPT persisted following completion of IPT. METHODS: Using mathematical modelling, we explored if this increased duration of protection may be due to an increased curative ability of IPT when given in combination with ART. The model was used to estimate the annual risk of infection and proportion of individuals whose latent infection was 'cured' by IPT, defined such that they must be reinfected to be at risk of disease. RESULTS: The estimated annual risk of infection was 4.0{\%} (2.6-5.8) and the estimated proportion of individuals whose latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection was cured following IPT was 35.4{\%} (2.4-76.4), higher than that previously estimated for HIV-infected/ART-naive individuals. Our results suggest that IPT can cure latent M. tuberculosis infection in approximately one-third of HIV-infected individuals on ART and therefore provide protection beyond the period of treatment. CONCLUSION: Among HIV-infected individuals on ART in low incidence settings, 12 months of IPT may provide additional long-term benefit. Among HIV-infected individuals on ART in high incidence settings, the durability of this protection will be limited because of continued risk of reinfection, and continuous preventive therapy together with improved infection control efforts will be required to provide long-term protection against TB.},

abstract = {It is unclear if current programmes in China can achieve the post-2015 global targets for tuberculosis - 50{\%} reduction, in incidence and a 75{\%} reduction in mortality by 2025. Chinese policy-makers need to maintain the recent decline in the prevalence of tuberculosis, while revising control policies to cope with an epidemic of drug-resistant tuberculosis and the effects of ongoing health reform. Health reforms are expected to shift patients from tuberculosis dispensaries to designated hospitals. We developed a mathematical model of tuberculosis control in China to help set appropriate targets and prioritize interventions that might be implemented in the next 10 years. This model indicates that, even under the most optimistic scenario - improved treatment in tuberculosis dispensaries, introduction of a new effective regimen for the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis and optimal care of cases of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis - the current global targets for tuberculosis are unlikely to be reached. However, reductions in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis should be feasible. We conclude that a shift of patients from tuberculosis dispensaries to designated hospitals is likely to hamper efforts at tuberculosis control if cure rates in the designated hospitals cannot be maintained at a high level. Our results can inform the planning of tuberculosis control in China.},

abstract = {In sub-Saharan Africa, where the emergence of HIV has caused dramatic increases in tuberculosis (TB) case notifications, new strategies for TB control are necessary. Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for HIV-TB coinfected individuals reduces the reactivation of latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections and is being evaluated as a potential community-wide strategy for improving TB control. We developed a mathematical model of TB/HIV coepidemics to examine the impact of community-wide implementation of IPT for TB-HIV coinfected individuals on the dynamics of drug-sensitive and -resistant TB epidemics. We found that community-wide IPT will reduce the incidence of TB in the short-term but may also speed the emergence of drug-resistant TB. We conclude that community-wide IPT in areas of emerging HIV and drug-resistant TB should be coupled with diagnostic and treatment policies designed to identify and effectively treat the increasing proportion of patients with drug-resistant TB.},

abstract = {South Africa has high rates of tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) strains. Expanding access to culture and drug susceptibility testing (DST) for TB diagnosis may help control this epidemic, but the potential impact of existing and novel TB diagnostics is uncertain. By fitting to World Health Organization epidemiological estimates, we developed a compartmental difference-equation model of the TB/HIV epidemic among South African adults. Performing culture and DST in 37{\%} of new cases and 85{\%} of previously treated cases was projected to save 47,955 lives (17.2{\%} reduction in TB mortality, 95{\%} simulation interval (S.I.) 8.9-24.4{\%}), avert 7,721 MDR-TB cases (14.1{\%} reduction, 95{\%} S.I. 5.3-23.8{\%}), and prevent 46.6{\%} of MDR-TB deaths (95{\%} S.I. 32.6-56.0{\%}) in South Africa over 10 years. Used alone, expanded culture and DST did not reduce XDR-TB incidence, but they enhanced the impact of transmission-reduction strategies, such as respiratory isolation. In South Africa, expanding TB culture and DST could substantially reduce TB, and particularly MDR-TB, mortality. Control of XDR-TB will require additional interventions, the impact of which may be enhanced by improved TB diagnosis.},

@article{Sershen2016,
abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis associated granuloma formation can be viewed as a structural immune response that can contain and halt the spread of the pathogen. In several mammalian hosts, including non-human primates, Mtb granulomas are often hypoxic, although this has not been observed in wild type murine infection models. While a presumed consequence, the structural contribution of the granuloma to oxygen limitation and the concomitant impact on Mtb metabolic viability and persistence remains to be fully explored. We develop a multiscale computational model to test to what extent in vivo Mtb granulomas become hypoxic, and investigate the effects of hypoxia on host immune response efficacy and mycobacterial persistence. Our study integrates a physiological model of oxygen dynamics in the extracellular space of alveolar tissue, an agent-based model of cellular immune response, and a systems biology-based model of Mtb metabolic dynamics. Our theoretical studies suggest that the dynamics of granuloma organization mediates oxygen availability and illustrates the immunological contribution of this structural host response to infection outcome. Furthermore, our integrated model demonstrates the link between structural immune response and mechanistic drivers influencing Mtbs adaptation to its changing microenvironment and the qualitative infection outcome scenarios of clearance, containment, dissemination, and a newly observed theoretical outcome of transient containment. We observed hypoxic regions in the containment granuloma similar in size to granulomas found in mammalian in vivo models of Mtb infection. In the case of the containment outcome, our model uniquely demonstrates that immune response mediated hypoxic conditions help foster the shift down of bacteria through two stages of adaptation similar to the in vitro non-replicating persistence (NRP) observed in the Wayne model of Mtb dormancy. The adaptation in part contributes to the ability of Mtb to remain dormant for years after initial infection.},

A tuberculosis model which incorporates the essential biological and epidemiological features of the disease such as exogenous reinfection and chemoprophylaxis of latently infected individuals, and treatment of the infectious is developed and rigorously analyzed. Based on this continuous model, the tuberculosis control is formulated and solved as an optimal control theory problem, indicating how a control term on the chemoprophylaxis should be introduced in the population to reduce the number of individuals with active TB. The feedback control law has been proved to be capable of reducing the number of individuals with active TB. An advantage is that the proposed scheme accounts for the energy wasted by the controller and the closed-loop performance on tracking. Numerical results show the performance of the optimization strategy.},

abstract = {Epidemic control strategies alter the spread of the disease in the host population. In this paper, we describe and discuss mathematical models that can be used to explore the potential of pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines currently under development in the control of tuberculosis. A model with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for the susceptibles and treatment for the infectives is first presented. The epidemic thresholds known as the basic reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined and stabilities are investigated. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the impact of the vaccines currently under development. The centre manifold theory is used to show the existence of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and that the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is greater than unity. From the study we conclude that the pre-exposure vaccine currently under development coupled with chemoprophylaxis for the latently infected and treatment of infectives is more effective when compared to the post-exposure vaccine currently under development for the latently infected coupled with treatment of the infectives.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In vaccine development, dose-response curves are commonly assumed to be saturating. Evidence from tuberculosis (TB) vaccine, H56+IC31 shows this may be incorrect. Mathematical modelling techniques may be useful in efficiently identifying the most immunogenic dose, but model calibration requires longitudinal data across multiple doses and time points. AIMS: We aimed to (i) generate longitudinal response data in mice for a wide range of H56+IC31 doses for use in future mathematical modelling and (ii) test whether a 'saturating' or 'peaked' dose-response curve, better fit the empirical data. METHODS: We measured IFN-gamma secretion using an ELISPOT assay in the splenocytes of mice who had received doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 or 15mug H56+IC31. Mice were vaccinated twice (at day 0 and 15) and responses measured for each dose at 8 time points over a 56-day period following first vaccination. Summary measures Area Under the Curve (AUC), peak and day 56 responses were compared between dose groups. Corrected Akaike Information Criteria was used to test which dose-response curve best fitted empirical data, at different time ranges. RESULTS: (i) All summary measures for dose groups 0.1 and 0.5mug were higher than the control group (p{\textless}0.05). The AUC was higher for 0.1 than 15mug dose. (ii) There was strong evidence that the dose-response curve was peaked for all time ranges, and the best dose is likely to be lower than previous empirical experiments have evaluated. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the highest, safe dose may not always optimal in terms of immunogenicity, as the dose-response curve may not saturate. Detailed longitudinal dose range data for TB vaccine H56+IC31 reveals response dynamics in mice that should now be used to identify optimal doses for humans using clinical data, using new data collection and mathematical modelling.},

abstract = {Multidrug resistance blaCMY-2 plasmids that confer resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins have been found in multiple bacterial species collected from different hosts worldwide. The widespread distribution of blaCMY-2 plasmids may be driven by antibiotic use that selects for the dissemination and persistence of these plasmids. Alternatively, these plasmids may persist and spread in bacterial populations in the absence of selection pressure if a balance exists among conjugative transfer, segregation loss during cell division, and fitness cost to the host. We conducted a series of experiments (both in vivo and in vitro) to study these mechanisms for three blaCMY-2 plasmids, peH4H, pAR060302, and pAM04528. Results of filter mating experiments showed that the conjugation efficiency of blaCMY-2 plasmids is variable, from {\textless}10(-7) for pAM04528 and peH4H to ∼10(-3) for pAR060302. Neither peH4H nor pAM04528 was transferred from Escherichia coli strain DH10B, but peH4H was apparently mobilized by the coresident trimethoprim resistance-encoding plasmid pTmpR. Competition studies showed that carriage of blaCMY-2 plasmids imposed a measurable fitness cost on the host bacteria both in vitro (0.095 to 0.25) and in vivo (dairy calf model). Long-term passage experiments in the absence of antibiotics demonstrated that plasmids with limited antibiotic resistance phenotypes arose, but eventually drug-sensitive, plasmid-free clones dominated the populations. Given that plasmid decay or loss is inevitable, we infer that some level of selection is required for the long-term persistence of blaCMY-2 plasmids in bacterial populations.},

abstract = {Adjusting for a causal intermediate is a common analytic strategy for estimating an average causal direct effect (ACDE). The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator performs more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB.},

BCG's limited efficacy coupled with the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis emphasizes the need for a more effective vaccine for combatting this disease. However, the development of a TB vaccine is hindered by the lack of immune correlates, suboptimal animal models, and limited funding. An adolescent/adult vaccine would have the greatest public health impact, but effective delivery of such a vaccine will require a better understanding of global TB epidemiology, improved infrastructure, and engagement of public health leaders and global manufacturers. Here we discuss the current state of tuberculosis vaccine research and development, including our understanding of the underlying immunology as well as the challenges and opportunities that may hinder or facilitate the development of a new and efficacious vaccine.},

abstract = {Although different structures are used in modern tuberculosis (TB) models to simulate TB latency, it remains unclear whether they are all capable of reproducing the particular activation dynamics empirically observed. We aimed to determine which of these structures replicate the dynamics of progression accurately. We reviewed 88 TB-modelling articles and classified them according to the latency structure employed. We then fitted these different models to the activation dynamics observed from 1352 infected contacts diagnosed in Victoria (Australia) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) to obtain parameter estimates. Six different model structures were identified, of which only those incorporating two latency compartments were capable of reproducing the activation dynamics empirically observed. We found important differences in parameter estimates by age. We also observed marked differences between our estimates and the parameter values used in many previous models. In particular, when two successive latency phases are considered, the first period should have a duration that is much shorter than that used in previous studies. In conclusion, structures incorporating two latency compartments and age-stratification should be employed to accurately replicate the dynamics of TB latency. We provide a catalogue of parameter values and an approach to parameter estimation from empiric data for calibration of future TB-models.},

abstract = {Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase (symptoms absent or not considered abnormal); prediagnostic phase (symptoms noticed but diagnosis not pursued); and clinical phase (care actively sought). Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited. Objectives: To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease. Methods: We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20{\%} ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10{\%} per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5{\%} of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active"). Measurements and Main Results: If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18{\%} (90{\%} uncertainty range [UR], 11-32{\%}) by year 10, compared with 23{\%} (90{\%} UR, 14-35{\%}) for the enhanced strategy and 18{\%} (90{\%} UR, 11-28{\%}) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16{\%} (90{\%} UR, 11-28{\%}), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11{\%} (90{\%} UR, 8-25{\%}) and 6{\%} (90{\%} UR, 4-13{\%}), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase. Conclusions: Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.},

Here, we explain how substantial biases are introduced by two important, yet largely ignored, assumptions at the core of the vast majority of such models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS AND FINDINGS: First, we use analytical methods to show that (i) ignoring the latent period or (ii) making the common assumption of exponentially distributed latent and infectious periods (when including the latent period) always results in underestimating the basic reproductive ratio of an infection from outbreak data. We then proceed to illustrate these points by fitting epidemic models to data from an influenza outbreak. Finally, we document how such unrealistic a priori assumptions concerning model structure give rise to systematically overoptimistic predictions on the outcome of potential management options.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: This work aims to highlight that, when developing models for public health use, we need to pay careful attention to the intrinsic assumptions embedded within classical frameworks.},

abstract = {Granulomas are a hallmark of tuberculosis. Inside granulomas, the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis may enter a metabolically inactive state that is less susceptible to antibiotics. Understanding M. tuberculosis metabolism within granulomas could contribute to reducing the lengthy treatment required for tuberculosis and provide additional targets for new drugs. Two key adaptations of M. tuberculosis are a nonreplicating phenotype and accumulation of lipid inclusions in response to hypoxic conditions. To explore how these adaptations influence granuloma-scale outcomes in vivo, we present a multiscale in silico model of granuloma formation in tuberculosis. The model comprises host immunity, M. tuberculosis metabolism, M. tuberculosis growth adaptation to hypoxia, and nutrient diffusion. We calibrated our model to in vivo data from nonhuman primates and rabbits and apply the model to predict M. tuberculosis population dynamics and heterogeneity within granulomas. We found that bacterial populations are highly dynamic throughout infection in response to changing oxygen levels and host immunity pressures. Our results indicate that a nonreplicating phenotype, but not lipid inclusion formation, is important for long-term M. tuberculosis survival in granulomas. We used virtual M. tuberculosis knockouts to predict the impact of both metabolic enzyme inhibitors and metabolic pathways exploited to overcome inhibition. Results indicate that knockouts whose growth rates are below approximately 66{\%} of the wild-type growth rate in a culture medium featuring lipid as the only carbon source are unable to sustain infections in granulomas. By mapping metabolite- and gene-scale perturbations to granuloma-scale outcomes and predicting mechanisms of sterilization, our method provides a powerful tool for hypothesis testing and guiding experimental searches for novel antituberculosis interventions.},

abstract = {Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has increased at an alarming rate in the WHO European Region. Of the 27 countries worldwide with a high burden of multidrug resistant-TB (MDR-TB), 15 are in the European Region. An estimated 78,000 new cases of MDR-TB occur annually in the Region, of which approximately 10{\%} are extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-TB. In response, the WHO Regional Office for Europe developed a Consolidated Action Plan to Prevent and Combat Multidrug- and Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (2011-2015). Our objective was to analyse the cost-effectiveness of implementing the plan, with the expected achievements of diagnosing 85{\%} of estimated MDR-TB cases and treating at least 75{\%} successfully. A transmission model, using epidemiological data reported to WHO was developed to calculate expected achievements. WHO-CHOICE database was used for cost analyses. The highly cost-effective plan is expected to prevent the emergence of 250,000 new MDR-TB and 13,000 XDR-TB patients respectively, saving US{\$}7 billion and 120,000 lives. The plan and accompanying Resolution were fully endorsed by the sixty-first session of the WHO Regional Committee for Europe in 2011. Member States need to continuously improve health system performance and address TB determinants. Research and development of new medicines, tools and patient-friendly services are also crucial.},

abstract = {Objective: Assess the current BCG vaccination policies and delivery pathways for immunisation in Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England since the 2005 change in recommendations. Design: A survey of key informants across PCTs using a standardised, structured questionnaire. Setting: 152 PCTs in England. Results: Complete questionnaires were returned from 127 (84{\%}) PCTs. Sixteen (27{\%}) PCTs reported universal infant vaccination and 111 (73{\%}) had selective infant vaccination. Selective vaccination outside infancy was also reported from 94 (74{\%}) PCTs. PCTs with selective infant policy most frequently vaccinated on postnatal wards (51/102, 50{\%}), whereas PCTs with universal infant vaccination most frequently vaccinated in community clinics (9/13, 69{\%}; p=0.011). To identify and flag up eligible infants in PCTs with targeted infant immunisation, those who mostly vaccinate on postnatal wards depend on midwives and maternity records, whereas those who vaccinate primarily in the community rely more often on various healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Targeted infant vaccination has been implemented in most PCTs across the UK. PCTs with selective infant vaccination provide BCG vaccine via a greater variety of healthcare professionals than those with universal infant vaccination policies. Data on vaccine coverage would help evaluate the effectiveness of delivery. Interruptions of delivery noted here emphasise the importance of not just an agreed, standardised, local pathway, but also a named person in charge.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Currently, an annual chest X-ray examination (CXR) for detection of active tuberculosis (TB) in employees aged {\textgreater}/=40 years is recommended in the guidelines of the Japan Industrial Safety and Health Law. Interferon-gamma release assays are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test for detecting Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, with higher specificity than the tuberculin skin test and without cross-reactivity with the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine. This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of employee TB screening using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) versus CXR. METHODS: Markov models were constructed. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of immunocompetent 40-year-old individuals, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3{\%}. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, the QFT strategy was the most cost-effective ({\$}US 262.84; 22.87049 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with no screening ({\$}448.38; 22.85452 QALYs) and CXR ({\$}543.50; 22.85453 QALYs) [year 2009 values]. CONCLUSION: The QFT strategy is currently robust for screening Bacille Calmette-Guerin- vaccinated employees in Japan. There appears to be little role for CXR. These findings may be applicable to other countries in terms of choosing optimal TB screening for employees.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the tuberculin skin test (TST), the QuantiFERON-TB Gold test (QFT) and a combination of TST and QFT (TST+QFT) for diagnosing latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in France in a bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccinated population. METHODS: A decision analysis model evaluated three strategies among simulated adults in close contact with tuberculosis (TB). We calculated direct lifetime medical costs, life expectancies and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). RESULTS: The discounted direct medical costs of care per patient of no testing, TST, QFT and TST+QFT were respectively euro417, euro476, euro443 and euro435, while discounted life expectancies were respectively 25.030, 25.071, 25.073 and 25.062 years. TST had higher costs and lower efficacy than QFT; TST+QFT was associated with an ICER of euro560 per year of life gained (YLG) compared to no testing, and QFT was associated with an ICER of euro730/YLG compared to TST+QFT. The only scenario where QFT was associated with an ICER of {\textgreater}euro75 000/YLG was when the prevalence of LTBI around TB was low ({\textless}5{\%}) and TST specificity high ({\textgreater}90{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In France, for the diagnosis of LTBI after close contact with TB, the TST is more expensive and less effective than QFT. Although it is more expensive, QFT is more effective and cost-effective than TST+QFT under a wide range of realistic test performance scenarios.},

These include symmetry of the 1) low energy effective action, 2) allowed spectrum of electric and magnetic charges in the theory, 3) allowed mass spectrum of particles saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound, and 4) Yukawa couplings between massless neutral particles and massive charged particles saturating the Bogomol'nyi bound. This duality transformation exchanges the electrically charged elementary string excitations with the magnetically charged soliton states in the theory. It is shown that the existence of a strong-weak coupling duality symmetry in four dimensional string theory makes definite prediction about the existence of new stable monopole and dyon states in the theory with specific degeneracies, including certain supersymmetric bound states of monopoles and dyons. The relationship between strong-weak coupling duality transformation in string theory and target space duality transformation in the five-brane theory is also discussed.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extrapulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB) and most pediatric TB cannot be diagnosed using sputum-based assays. The epidemiological impact of different strategies to diagnose EPTB and pediatric TB is unclear. METHODS: We developed a dynamic epidemic model of TB in a hypothetical population with epidemiological characteristics similar to India. We evaluated the impact of four alternative diagnostic test platforms on adult EPTB and pediatric TB mortality over 10 years: (1) Nucleic acid amplification test optimized for diagnosis of EPTB ("NAAT-EPTB"); (2) NAAT optimized for pediatric TB ("NAAT-Peds"); (3) more deployable NAAT for sputum-based diagnosis of adult pulmonary TB ("point-of-care (POC) sputum NAAT"); and (4) more deployable NAAT capable of diagnosing all forms of TB using non-invasive, non-sputum specimens ("POC non-sputum NAAT"). RESULTS: NAAT-EPTB lowered adult EPTB mortality by a projected 7.6{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range [UR]: 6.5-8.8{\%}). NAAT-Peds lowered pediatric TB mortality by 6.8{\%} (UR: 4.9-8.4{\%}). POC sputum NAAT, though only able to diagnose pulmonary TB, reduced projected pediatric TB deaths by 13.3{\%} (UR: 4.6-15.7{\%}) and adult EPTB deaths by 8.4{\%} (UR 2.0-9.3{\%}) simply by averting transmission of disease. POC non-sputum NAAT had the greatest effect, lowering pediatric TB mortality by 34.7{\%} (UR: 26.8-38.7), and adult EPTB mortality by 38.5{\%} (UR: 30.7-41.2). The relative impact of a POC sputum NAAT (i.e., enhanced deployability) versus NAAT-EPTB (i.e., enhanced ability to specifically diagnose TB-NSP) on adult EPTB mortality depends most strongly on factors that influence transmission, with settings of higher transmission (e.g., higher per-person transmission rate, lower diagnostic rate) favoring POC sputum NAAT. CONCLUSION: Although novel tests for pediatric TB and EPTB are likely to reduce TB mortality, major reductions in pediatric and EPTB incidence and mortality also require better diagnostic tests for adult pulmonary TB that reach a larger population.},

abstract = {Data from the UK Labour Force Survey (LFS) are used to examine two methodological issues in the analysis of the relationship between age and work-related health. First, the LFS is unusual in that it asks work-related health questions to those who are not currently employed. This facilitates a more representative analysis than that which is constrained to focus only on those currently in work. Second, information in the LFS facilitates a comparison of work-related health problems that stem from current employment to a more encompassing measure that includes those related to a former job. We find that accounting for each of these sources of bias increases the age work-related health risk gradient, and suggest that ignoring such effects will underestimate the work-related health implications of current policies to extend working lives. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd and London School of Economics.},

One of the changes has been the abandonment of the long standing school's BCG programme because of the low risk of TB in that population. The other change has been the targeting of those infants and children at increased risk of TB, particularly in populations with increased rates of TB. However, there remain questions as to what role BCG plays in TB control and prevention in the UK.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has gained popularity over the past few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetics, epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a deterministic non-linear mathematical model for the transmission dynamics of HIV and TB co-infection and analyze it in the presence of screening and treatment. The equilibria of the model are computed and stability of these equilibria is discussed. The basic reproduction numbers corresponding to both HIV and TB are found and we show that the disease-free equilibrium is stable only when the basic reproduction numbers for both the diseases are less than one. When both the reproduction numbers are greater than one, the co-infection equilibrium point may exist. The co-infection equilibrium is found to be locally stable whenever it exists. The TB-only and HIV-only equilibria are locally asymptotically stable under some restriction on parameters. We present numerical simulation results to support the analytical findings. We observe that screening with proper counseling of HIV infectives results in a significant reduction of the number of individuals progressing to HIV. Additionally, the screening of TB reduces the infection prevalence of TB disease. The results reported in this paper clearly indicate that proper screening and counseling can check the spread of HIV and TB diseases and effective control strategies can be formulated around 'screening with proper counseling'.},

Here we bypass the conventional human-disease models, and propose that bubonic plague is driven by the dynamics of the disease in the rat population. Using a stochastic, spatial metapopulation model, we show that bubonic plague can persist in relatively small rodent populations from which occasional human epidemics arise, without the need for external imports. This explains why historically the plague persisted despite long disease-free periods, and how the disease re-occurred in cities with tight quarantine control. In a contemporary setting, we show that human vaccination cannot eradicate the plague, and that culling of rats may prevent or exacerbate human epidemics, depending on the timing of the cull. The existence of plague reservoirs in wild rodent populations has important public-health implications for the transmission to urban rats and the subsequent risk of human outbreaks.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for improved estimations of the burden of tuberculosis (TB). OBJECTIVE: To develop a new quantitative method based on mathematical modelling, and to demonstrate its application to TB in India. DESIGN: We developed a simple model of TB transmission dynamics to estimate the annual incidence of TB disease from the annual risk of tuberculous infection and prevalence of smear-positive TB. We first compared model estimates for annual infections per smear-positive TB case using previous empirical estimates from China, Korea and the Philippines. We then applied the model to estimate TB incidence in India, stratified by urban and rural settings. RESULTS: Study model estimates show agreement with previous empirical estimates. Applied to India, the model suggests an annual incidence of smear-positive TB of 89.8 per 100 000 population (95{\%}CI 56.8-156.3). Results show differences in urban and rural TB: while an urban TB case infects more individuals per year, a rural TB case remains infectious for appreciably longer, suggesting the need for interventions tailored to these different settings. CONCLUSIONS: Simple models of TB transmission, in conjunction with necessary data, can offer approaches to burden estimation that complement those currently being used.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Resistance to commonly used antituberculosis drugs is emerging worldwide. Conventional drug-susceptibility testing (DST) methods are slow and demanding. Alternative, rapid DST methods would permit the early detection of drug resistance and, in turn, arrest tuberculosis transmission. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis of 5 DST methods was performed in the context of a clinical trial that compared rapid with conventional DST methods. The methods under investigation were direct phage-replication assay (FASTPlaque-Response; Biotech), direct amplification and reverse hybridization of the rpoB gene (INNO-LiPA; Innogenetics), indirect colorimetric minimum inhibitory concentration assay (MTT; ICN Biomedicals), and direct proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. These were compared with the widely used indirect proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium. RESULTS: All alternative DST methods were found to be cost-effective, compared with other health care interventions. DST methods also generate substantial cost savings in settings of high prevalence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Excluding the effects of transmission, the direct proportion method on Lowenstein-Jensen medium was the most cost-effective alternative DST method for patient groups with prevalences of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis of 2{\%}, 5{\%}, 20{\%}, and 50{\%} (cost in US{\$}2004, {\$}94, {\$}36, {\$}8, and {\$}2 per disability-adjusted life year, respectively). CONCLUSION: Alternative, rapid methods for DST are cost-effective and should be considered for use by national tuberculosis programs in middle-income countries.},

@article{Vynnycky2001,
abstract = {Though it is recognized that the extent of 'clustering' of isolates from tuberculosis cases in a given population is related to the amount of disease attributable to recent transmission, the relationship between the two statistics is poorly understood. Given age-dependent risks of disease and the fact that a long study (e.g. spanning several years) is more likely to identify transmission-linked cases than a shorter study, both measures, and thus the relationship between them, probably depend strongly on the ages of the cases ascertained and study duration. The contribution of these factors is explored in this paper using an age-structured model which describes the introduction and transmission of M. tuberculosis strains with different DNA fingerprint patterns in The Netherlands during this century, assuming that the number of individuals contacted by each case varies between cases and that DNA fingerprint patterns change over time through random mutations, as observed in several studies. Model predictions of clustering in different age groups and over different time periods between 1993 and 1997 compare well against those observed. According to the model, the proportion of young cases with onset in a given time period who were 'clustered' underestimated the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission in this age group (by up to 25{\%} in males); for older individuals, clustering overestimated this proportion. These under- and overestimates decreased and increased respectively as the time period over which the cases were ascertained increased. These results have important implications for the interpretation of estimates of the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission, based on 'clustering' statistics, as are being derived from studies of the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis in many populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No treatment regimens have been specifically designed for children, in whom tuberculosis is predominantly intracellular. Given their activity as monotherapy and their ability to penetrate many diseased anatomic sites that characterize disseminated tuberculosis, linezolid and moxifloxacin could be combined to form a regimen for this need. METHODS: We examined microbial kill of intracellular Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) by the combination of linezolid and moxifloxacin multiple exposures in a 7-by-7 mathematical matrix. We then used the hollow fiber system (HFS) model of intracellular tuberculosis to identify optimal dose schedules and exposures of moxifloxacin and linezolid in combination. We mimicked pediatric half-lives and concentrations achieved by each drug. We sampled the peripheral compartment on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 for Mtb quantification, and compared the slope of microbial kill of Mtb by these regimens to the standard regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide, based on exponential decline regression. RESULTS: The full exposure-response surface identified linezolid-moxifloxacin zones of synergy, antagonism, and additivity. A regimen based on each of these zones was then used in the HFS model, with observed half-lives of 4.08 +/- 0.66 for linezolid and 3.80 +/- 1.34 hours for moxifloxacin. The kill rate constant was 0.060 +/- 0.012 per day with the moxifloxacin-linezolid regimen in the additivity zone vs 0.083 +/- 0.011 per day with standard therapy, translating to a bacterial burden half-life of 11.52 days vs 8.53 days, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: We identified doses and dose schedules of a linezolid and moxifloxacin backbone regimen that could be highly efficacious in disseminated tuberculosis in children.},

abstract = {Measuring tuberculosis transmission is exceedingly difficult, given the remarkable variability in the timing of clinical disease after Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection; incident disease can result from either a recent (ie, weeks to months) or a remote (ie, several years to decades) infection event. Although we cannot identify with certainty the timing and location of tuberculosis transmission for individuals, approaches for estimating the individual probability of recent transmission and for estimating the fraction of tuber-culosis cases due to recent transmission in populations have been developed. Data used to estimate the probable burden of recent transmission include tuberculosis case notifications in young children and trends in tuberculin skin test and interferon $\gamma$–release assays. More recently, M. tuberculosis whole-genome sequencing has been used to estimate population levels of recent transmission, identify the distribution of specific strains within communities, and decipher chains of transmission among culture-positive tuber-culosis cases. The factors that drive the transmission of tuberculosis in communities depend on the burden of prevalent tuberculosis; the ways in which individuals live, work, and interact (eg, congregate settings); and the capacity of healthcare and public health sys-tems to identify and effectively treat individuals with infectious forms of tuberculosis. Here we provide an overview of these factors, describe tools for measurement of ongoing transmission, and highlight knowledge gaps that must be addressed.},

abstract = {Summary. Many modern statistical applications involve inference for complex stochastic models, where it is easy to simulate from the models, but impossible to calculate likelihoods. Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) is a method of inference for such models. It replaces calculation of the likelihood by a step which involves simulating artificial data for different parameter values, and comparing summary statistics of the simulated data with summary statistics of the observed data. Here we show how to construct appropriate summary statistics for ABC in a semi-automatic manner. We aim for summary statistics which will enable inference about certain parameters of interest to be as accurate as possible. Theoretical results show that optimal summary statistics are the posterior means of the parameters. Although these cannot be calculated analytically, we use an extra stage of simulation to estimate how the posterior means vary as a function of the data; and we then use these estimates of our summary statistics within ABC. Empirical results show that our approach is a robust method for choosing summary statistics that can result in substantially more accurate ABC analyses than the ad hoc choices of summary statistics that have been proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate advantages over two alternative methods of simulation-based inference.},

@article{Vynnycky2000a,
abstract = {The lifetime risk of developing disease, the incubation period, and the time period between infection and transmission (the serial interval) are three important measures for interpreting trends in tuberculous infection and disease but are complicated by strong age dependencies regarding disease risk and by the potential for reinfection to occur. By using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales, the authors demonstrated that all three measures changed dramatically during the 20th century largely as a result of declines in the risk of infection. The estimated lifetime risk was highest following infection in early adulthood and declined with year of infection; the age-weighted average was approximately 12{\%} during the last 50 years. Incubation period distributions depend on whether they are viewed prospectively (from infection to disease onset) or retrospectively (since infection for cases with disease onset at a particular time). As children rarely develop infectious forms of tuberculosis, infections acquired in childhood are associated with considerably longer serial intervals than those acquired in adulthood. These unusual properties are probably shared by other infections with long intervals between infection and disease. The results are important for interpreting data on transmission patterns, as are now being derived from molecular epidemiologic studies.},

@article{Verguet2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenses often lead to catastrophic expenditure and impoverishment in low- and middle-income countries. Yet, there has been no systematic examination of which specific diseases and conditions (e.g., tuberculosis, cardiovascular disease) drive medical impoverishment, defined as OOP direct medical costs pushing households into poverty. METHODS: We used a cost and epidemiological model to propose an assessment of the burden of medical impoverishment in Ethiopia, i.e., the number of households crossing a poverty line due to excessive OOP direct medical expenses. We utilized disease-specific mortality estimates from the Global Burden of Disease study, epidemiological and cost inputs from surveys, and secondary data from the literature to produce a count of poverty cases due to OOP direct medical costs per specific condition. RESULTS: In Ethiopia, in 2013, and among 20 leading causes of mortality, we estimated the burden of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs to be of about 350,000 poverty cases. The top three causes of medical impoverishment were diarrhea, lower respiratory infections, and road injury, accounting for 75 {\%} of all poverty cases. CONCLUSIONS: We present a preliminary attempt for the estimation of the burden of medical impoverishment by cause for high mortality conditions. In Ethiopia, medical impoverishment was notably associated with illness occurrence and health services utilization. Although currently used estimates are sensitive to health services utilization, a systematic breakdown of impoverishment due to OOP direct medical costs by cause can provide important information for the promotion of financial risk protection and equity, and subsequent design of health policies toward universal health coverage, reduction of direct OOP payments, and poverty alleviation.},

abstract = {The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports an ambitious portfolio of novel vaccines, drug regimens, and diagnostic tools for tuberculosis (TB). We elicited the expected efficacies and improvements of the novel interventions in discussions with the foundations managing their development. Using an age-structured mathematical model of TB, we explored the potential benefits of novel interventions under development and those not yet in the portfolio, focusing on the WHO Southeast Asia region. Neonatal vaccination with the portfolio vaccine decreases TB incidence by 39{\%} to 52{\%} by 2050. Drug regimens that shorten treatment duration and are efficacious against drug-resistant strains reduce incidence by 10-27{\%}. New diagnostics reduce incidence by 13-42{\%}. A triple combination of a portfolio vaccine, drug regimen, and diagnostics reduces incidence by 71{\%}. A short mass vaccination catch-up campaign, not yet in the portfolio, to augment the triple combination, accelerates the decrease, preventing {\textgreater}30{\%} more cases by 2050 than just the triple combination. New vaccines and drug regimens targeted at the vast reservoir of latently infected people, not in the portfolio, would reduce incidence by 37{\%} and 82{\%}, respectively. The combination of preventive latent therapy and a 2-month drug treatment regimen reduces incidence by 94{\%}. Novel technologies in the pipeline would achieve substantial reductions in TB incidence, but not the Stop TB Partnership target for elimination. Elimination will require new delivery strategies, such as mass vaccination campaigns, and new products targeted at latently infected people.},

Four- teen prospective trials and 12 case-control studies were included in the analysis. Data Extraction.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Werecorded study design, age range of study population, number of patients enrolled, efficacy of vaccine, and items to assess the potential for bias in study design and diagnosis. At least two readers independently extracted data and evaluated validity. Data Synthesis.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Therelative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of TB provided the measure of vaccine efficacy that we analyzed. The protective effect was then com- puted by 1 $\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$RRor 1 $\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$OR.A random-effects model estimated a weighted average RR or OR from those provided by the trials or case-control studies. In the trials, the RR of TB was 0.49 (95{\%} confidence interval [Cl], 0.34 to 0.70) for vaccine recipi- ents compared with nonrecipients (protective effect of 51{\%}). In the case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95{\%} CI, 0.39 to 0.64), or a 50{\%} protective effect. Seven trials reporting tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 71{\%} (RR, 0.29; 95{\%} Cl, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 64{\%} (OR, 0.36; 95{\%} Cl, 0.18 to 0.70). Geographic latitude of the study site and study validity score explained 66{\%} of the heterogeneity among trials in a random-effects regression model. Conclusion.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Onaverage, BCG vaccine significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50{\%}. Protection is observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG efficacy. Protec- tion against tuberculous death, meningitis, and disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although this result may reflect reduced error in disease clas- sification rather than greater BCG efficacy.},

HIV and resistance to antimycobacterial medications have evolutionary implications for how Mycobacterium tuberculosis will evolve, as these factors influence the host environment and transmission dynamics of tuberculosis strains. We present an evolutionary invasion analysis of tuberculosis that characterizes the direction of tuberculosis evolution in the context of different natural and human-driven selective pressures, including changes in tuberculosis treatment and HIV prevalence. We find that the evolution of tuberculosis virulence can be affected by treatment success rates, the relative transmissibility of emerging strains, the rate of reactivation from latency among hosts, and the life expectancy of hosts. We find that the virulence of tuberculosis strains may also increase as a consequence of rising HIV prevalence, requiring faster case detection strategies in areas where the epidemics of HIV and tuberculosis collide.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. METHODS: A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. RESULTS: The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.},

In this paper, we describe and discuss mathematical models that can be used to explore the potential of pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines currently under development in the control of tuberculosis. A model with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for the susceptibles and treatment for the infectives is first presented. The epidemic thresholds known as the basic reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined and stabilities are investigated. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the impact of the vaccines currently under development. The centre manifold theory is used to show the existence of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and that the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is greater than unity. From the study we conclude that the pre-exposure vaccine currently under development coupled with chemoprophylaxis for the latently infected and treatment of infectives is more effective when compared to the post-exposure vaccine currently under development for the latently infected coupled with treatment of the infectives. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {More than 36 million patients have been successfully treated via the World Health Organization's strategy for tuberculosis (TB) control since 1995. Despite predictions of a decline in global incidence, the number of new cases continues to grow, approaching 10 million in 2010. Here we review the changing relationship between the causative agent, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and its human host and examine a range of factors that could explain the persistence of TB. Although there are ways to reduce susceptibility to infection and disease, and a high-efficacy vaccine would boost TB prevention, early diagnosis and drug treatment to interrupt transmission remain the top priorities for control. Whatever the technology used, success depends critically on the social, institutional, and epidemiological context in which it is applied},

The next two chapters present important recent discoveries about strongly coupled strings, beginning with a detailed treatment of D-branes and their dynamics, and covering string duality, M-theory, and black hole entropy. A following chapter collects many classic results in conformal field theory. The final four chapters are concerned with four-dimensional string theories, and have two goals: to show how some of the simplest string models connect with previous ideas for unifying the Standard Model; and to collect many important and beautiful general results on world-sheet and spacetime symmetries. An appendix summarizes the necessary background on fermions and supersymmetry.},

abstract = {The aims of this paper were to estimate the numbers of tuberculosis notifications in young white adults which will be prevented in the next 25 years by the schools BCG vaccination scheme, and to assess the numbers of additional notifications if the scheme were to be discontinued. Assuming that in the white ethnic group in England and Wales the decline in tuberculosis notification rates (8-10{\%} per year for ages less than 45 years) and efficacy of BCG vaccination (75-80{\%}) are maintained, it is estimated that the scheme for BCG vaccination of schoolchildren with its present coverage will prevent 217 notifications in those aged 15-29 years in 1993, 119 in 1998, and 69 in 2003. The epidemiological consequences of stopping the BCG in schools scheme, whenever this occurs, would be a substantial slowing of the rate of decline of tuberculosis notifications, confined almost entirely to the 15-29 years age group, for a period of about 15 years, after which the steeper decline would resume. If the scheme stopped at the end of 1991 the annual number of additional notifications would slowly increase to a maximum of just over 80 about 15 years later, and then decrease. For stopping at the end of 1996 the maximum annual number of additional notifications would be about 50.},

The Lyapunov principle is commonly used to examine and determine the stability of a dynamic system. To simulate the transmissions of vector-borne diseases and discuss the related health policies effects on vector-borne diseases, the authors combine the multi-agent-based system, social network and compartmental model to develop an epidemic simulation model. In the identity level, the authors use the multi-agent-based system and the mirror identity concept to describe identities with social network features such as daily visits, long-distance movement, high degree of clustering, low degree of separation and local clustering. The research will analyse the complex dynamic mathematic model of TB epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages. Facing the current TB epidemic situation, the development of TB and its developing trend through constructing a dynamic bio-mathematical system model of TB is investigated. After simulating the development of epidemic situation with the solution of the SMIR epidemic model, the authors will come up with a good scheme to control epidemic situation to analyse the parameter values of a model that influence epidemic situation evolved. The authors will try to find the quarantining parameters that are the most important factors to control epidemic situation. The SMIR epidemic model and the results via numerical analysis may offer effective prevention with reference to controlling epidemic situation of TB.},

This article adapts and validates - with surveillance data - a theoretical model estimating the impact of different national BCG vaccination policies on severe childhood TB in low to intermediate TB prevalent countries. The model shows that a universal BCG programme could be beneficial in settings with prevalence levels around 30 sputum smear positive per 100,000. In settings with prevalence levels below 15 per 100,000 the benefit of universal BCG vaccination should be carefully assessed, particularly where prevalence is below 5 per 100,000 and universal vaccination might lead to an excess of adverse events per case prevented. To this purpose the model also provides a tool to assess the theoretical impact of a policy change towards selective 'high-risk groups' vaccination. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, a majority of children do not possess vaccination cards compiling information on timing. We investigated the benefits of vaccination cards for the uptake of immunizations against diphtheria, pertussis and tetanus (DPT), polio, tuberculosis (BCG), and measles using data on over 200,000 Indian children from the District Level Health and Facility Survey 3. Methodological issues such as whether parents of children with higher morbidity levels may have them vaccinated were investigated. The results from the models for DPT, polio, measles, and BCG vaccinations showed significant beneficial effects of maternal education, household possessions, and access to health care facilities. Moreover, models for children's ages at the time of vaccination showed significant interactions between maternal education and access to and availability of health care facilities. Finally, models for child morbidity due to diarrhea, cough, and fever showed that timely vaccinations against DPT, access to piped water, and cooking with electricity or natural gas were associated with lower morbidity. Overall, issuing paper or electronic vaccination cards to children is likely to enhance timely uptake of various immunizations thereby reducing child morbidity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Timely diagnosis and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) through screening remains a key public health priority. Although globally it is recommended to screen people at high risk of developing TB, the economic evidence underpinning these recommendations is limited. This review critically appraised studies that had used a decision-analytical modelling framework to estimate the cost-effectiveness of interferon gamma release assays (IGRAs) compared to tuberculin skin test (TST) for detecting LTBI in high risk populations. METHODS: A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, NHS-EED was undertaken from 2009 up to June 2015. Studies were screened and extracted by independent reviewers. The study quality was assessed using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) and the Philips' checklist, respectively. A narrative synthesis of the included studies was undertaken. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in this review. Two economic evaluations were conducted in a child population, six in an immunocompromised population and two in a recently arrived population from a country with a high incidence of TB. Most studies (n = 7) used a decision tree structure with Markov nodes. In general, all models were clearly described in terms of reporting quality, but were subject to limitations to structure and model inputs. Models have not elaborated on their setting or the perspective of the studies was not consistent with their analyses. Other concerns were related to derivation of prevalence, test accuracy and transition probabilities. CONCLUSION: Current methods available highlight limitations in the clinical effectiveness literature, model structures and assumptions, which impact on the robustness of the cost-effectiveness results. These models available are useful, but limited on the information that can be used to inform on future cost-effectiveness analysis. Until consideration is given on deriving the performance of tests used to identify LTBI that progresses to active TB, and the development of more comprehensive models, the economic benefit of LTBI testing with TST/IGRAs in high risk populations will remain unanswered.},

abstract = {Networks and the epidemiology of directly transmitted infectious diseases are fundamentally linked. The foundations of epidemiology and early epidemiological models were based on population wide random-mixing, but in practice each individual has a finite set of contacts to whom they can pass infection; the ensemble of all such contacts forms a 'mixing network'. Knowledge of the structure of the network allows models to compute the epidemic dynamics at the population scale from the individual-level behaviour of infections. Therefore, characteristics of mixing networks-and how these deviate from the random-mixing norm-have become important applied concerns that may enhance the understanding and prediction of epidemic patterns and intervention measures. Here, we review the basis of epidemiological theory (based on random-mixing models) and network theory (based on work from the social sciences and graph theory). We then describe a variety of methods that allow the mixing network, or an approximation to the network, to be ascertained. It is often the case that time and resources limit our ability to accurately find all connections within a network, and hence a generic understanding of the relationship between network structure and disease dynamics is needed. Therefore, we review some of the variety of idealized network types and approximation techniques that have been utilized to elucidate this link. Finally, we look to the future to suggest how the two fields of network theory and epidemiological modelling can deliver an improved understanding of disease dynamics and better public health through effective disease control.},

abstract = {Although tuberculosis (TB) screening of immigrants has been conducted for over 50 yr in many industrialized countries, its cost- effectiveness has never been evaluated. We prospectively compared the yield and cost-effectiveness of two immigrant TB screening programs, using close-contact investigation and passive case detection. Study subjects included all immigration applicants undergoing radiographic screening, already arrived immigrants requiring surveillance for inactive TB, and close contacts of active cases resident in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, who were referred from June 1996 to June 1997 to the Montreal Chest Institute (MCI), a referral center specializing in respiratory diseases. For all subjects seen, demographic data, investigations, diagnoses, and therapy were abstracted from administrative data bases and medical charts. Estimated costs of detecting and treating each prevalent active case and preventing future active cases, based on federal and provincial health reimbursement schedules, were compared with the costs for passively diagnosed cases of active TB. Over a period of 1 yr, the three programs detected 27 cases of prevalent active TB and prevented 14 future cases. As compared with passive case detection, close-contact investigation resulted in net savings of {\$}815 for each prevalent active case detected and treated and of {\$}2,186 for each future active case prevented. The incremental cost to treat each case of prevalent active TB was {\$}39,409 for applicant screening and {\$}24,225 for surveillance, and the cost of preventing each case was {\$}33,275 for applicants and {\$}65,126 for surveillance. Close-contact investigation was highly cost effective and resulted in net savings. Immigrant applicant screening and surveillance programs had a significant impact but were much less cost effective, in large part because of substantial operational problems.},

abstract = {Effective treatment for tuberculosis (TB) patients on first-line treatment involves triaging those with drug-resistant (DR) TB to appropriate treatment alternatives. Patients likely to have DR TB are identified using results from repeated inexpensive sputum-smear (SS) tests and expensive but definitive drug sensitivity tests (DST). Early DST may lead to high costs and unnecessary testing; late DST may lead to poor health outcomes and disease transmission. We use a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) framework to determine optimal DST timing. We develop policy-relevant structural properties of the POMDP model. We apply our model to TB in India to identify the patterns of SS test results that should prompt DST if transmission costs remain at status-quo levels. Unlike previous analyses of personalized treatment policies, we take a societal perspective and consider the effects of disease transmission. The inclusion of such effects can significantly alter the optimal policy. We find that an optimal DST policy could save India approximately {\$}1.9 billion annually.},

abstract = {Threat of co-epidemic HIV-111 is a major problem that must be faced by countries around the world. In 2011, approximately about one-third of the 34 million people living with HIV worldwide is infected with latent TB. Persons co-infected with TB and HIV are 21-34 times more likely to develop active TB disease than persons without HIV. In this paper, we develop a simple co-epidemic model of HIV-TB. We calculate the basic reproduction ratio at the disease-free equilibrium, and the quasidisease-free equilibrium, which we define as the existence of one disease along with the complete eradication of the other disease, and the co-infection equilibrium for specific conditions. Using this model, we study co-epidemic HIV-TB in Indonesia based on demography data in 2009 to explore the effects of hypothetical prevention and treatment scenarios. Our simple model of coepidemic HIV-TB describes the importance of including the effects of HIV on 113 and vice versa on the transmission and progression of the HIV and TB epidemic.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A mathematical model was designed to explore the impact of three strategies for better tuberculosis case finding. Strategies included: (1) reducing the number of tuberculosis patients who do not seek care; (2) reducing diagnostic delay; and (3) engaging non-DOTS providers in the referral of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS services in the Indonesian health system context. The impact of these strategies on tuberculosis mortality and treatment outcome was estimated using a mathematical model of the Indonesian health system. METHODS: The model consists of multiple compartments representing logical movement of a respiratory symptomatic (tuberculosis suspect) through the health system, including patient- and health system delays. Main outputs of the model are tuberculosis death rate and treatment outcome (i.e. full or partial cure). We quantified the model parameters for the Jogjakarta province context, using a two round Delphi survey with five Indonesian tuberculosis experts. RESULTS: The model validation shows that four critical model outputs (average duration of symptom onset to treatment, detection rate, cure rate, and death rate) were reasonably close to existing available data, erring towards more optimistic outcomes than are actually reported. The model predicted that an intervention to reduce the proportion of tuberculosis patients who never seek care would have the biggest impact on tuberculosis death prevention, while an intervention resulting in more referrals of tuberculosis suspects to DOTS facilities would yield higher cure rates. This finding is similar for situations where the alternative sector is a more important health resource, such as in most other parts of Indonesia. CONCLUSION: We used mathematical modeling to explore the impact of Indonesian health system interventions on tuberculosis treatment outcome and deaths. Because detailed data were not available regarding the current Indonesian population, we relied on expert opinion to quantify the parameters. The fact that the model output showed similar results to epidemiological data suggests that the experts had an accurate understanding of this subject, thereby reassuring the quality of our predictions. The model highlighted the potential effectiveness of active case finding of tuberculosis patients with limited access to DOTS facilities in the developing country setting.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has gained popularity over the past few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetics, epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {One-third of the world population (approximately 2 billion individuals) is currently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the vast majority harboring a latent infection. As the risk of reactivation is around 10{\%} in a lifetime, it follows that 200 million of these will eventually develop active pulmonary disease. Only therapeutic or post-exposure interventions can tame this vast reservoir of infection. Treatment of latent infections can reduce the risk of reactivation, and there is accumulating evidence that combination with post-exposure vaccines can reduce the risk of reinfection. Here we develop mathematical models to explore the potential of these post-exposure interventions to control tuberculosis on a global scale. Intensive programs targeting recent infections appear generally effective, but the benefit is potentially greater in intermediate prevalence scenarios. Extending these strategies to longer-term persistent infections appears more beneficial where prevalence is low. Finally, we consider that susceptibility to reinfection is altered by therapy, and explore its epidemiological consequences. When we assume that therapy reduces susceptibility to subsequent reinfection, catastrophic dynamics are observed. Thus, a bipolar outcome is obtained, where either small or large reductions in prevalence levels result, depending on the rate of detection and treatment of latent infections. By contrast, increased susceptibility after therapy may induce an increase in disease prevalence and does not lead to catastrophic dynamics. These potential outcomes are silent unless a widespread intervention is implemented.},

Provided current control efforts are maintained, elimination in the US-born population can be achieved before the end of this century. However, elimination in the foreign-born population is unlikely in this timeframe even with higher rates of targeted testing and treatment of residents of and immigrants to the USA with latent tuberculosis infection.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a major threat to global TB control. MDR-TB treatment regimens typically have a high pill burden, last 20 months or more and often lead to unsatisfactory outcomes. A 9-11 month regimen with seven antibiotics has shown high success rates among selected MDR-TB patients in different settings and is conditionally recommended by the World Health Organization. METHODS: We construct a transmission-dynamic model of TB to estimate the likely impact of a shorter MDR-TB regimen when applied in a low HIV prevalence region of Uzbekistan (Karakalpakstan) with high rates of drug resistance, good access to diagnostics and a well-established community-based MDR-TB treatment programme providing treatment to around 400 patients. The model incorporates acquisition of additional drug resistance and incorrect regimen assignment. It is calibrated to local epidemiology and used to compare the impact of shorter treatment against four alternative programmatic interventions. RESULTS: Based on empirical outcomes among MDR-TB patients and assuming no improvement in treatment success rates, the shorter regimen reduced MDR-TB incidence from 15.2 to 9.7 cases per 100,000 population per year and MDR-TB mortality from 3.0 to 1.7 deaths per 100,000 per year, achieving comparable or greater gains than the alternative interventions. No significant increase in the burden of higher levels of resistance was predicted. Effects are probably conservative given that the regimen is likely to improve success rates. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to benefits to individual patients, we find that shorter MDR-TB treatment regimens also have the potential to reduce transmission of resistant strains. These findings are in the epidemiological setting of treatment availability being an important bottleneck due to high numbers of patients being eligible for treatment, and may differ in other contexts. The high proportion of MDR-TB with additional antibiotic resistance simulated was not exacerbated by programmatic responses and greater gains may be possible in contexts where the regimen is more widely applicable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is provided to over 100 million neonates annually to protect against childhood tuberculosis (TB). Recent BCG manufacturing interruptions highlight global supply risks. We estimated the potential impact of BCG shortfalls on global paediatric ({\textless}15 years) TB mortality. METHODS: A static mathematical model was employed to estimate the number of paediatric TB deaths avoided by usual levels of BCG coverage, and potential additional TB deaths in the first 15 years of life due to 1-year BCG supply shortfalls of 6.3 {\%} (as occurred in 2015) to 27.6 {\%} (as anticipated without mitigating action in 2015) assuming no catch-up campaigns. RESULTS: BCG coverage without shortfalls, estimated at 90 {\%} globally, was estimated to avoid 117,132 (95 {\%} uncertainty range (UR): 5049-306,911) TB deaths globally per birth cohort in the first 15 years of life. An estimated 11,713 (UR: 505-30,691) additional TB deaths would occur in the first 15 years of life per 10 {\%} (26 million dose) annual supply shortfall. A 16.5 million dose (6.3 {\%}) shortfall as reported at the close of 2015, reflecting 84 {\%} global coverage, was estimated as associated with 7433 (95 {\%} UR: 320-19,477) excess TB deaths in the affected cohort in the first 15 years. A possible 24,914 (UR: 1074-65,278) additional deaths were avoided due to prompt shortfall reduction measures in 2015. CONCLUSIONS: BCG shortages could greatly increase paediatric TB mortality. Although rapid action in 2015 minimised BCG shortfalls, avoiding a large number of potential additional deaths, the possible public health impact of even relatively small shortfalls highlights the critical importance of ensuring secure future manufacturing capacity and global BCG supply continuity.},

abstract = {Background: BCG vaccine has shown consistently high efficacy against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis, but variable efficacy against adult pulmonary tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases. We assess and compare the costs and effects of BCG as an intervention against severe childhood tuberculosis in different regions of the world. Methods: We calculated the number of tuberculous meningitis and miliary tuberculosis cases that have been and will be prevented in all children born in 2002, by combining estimates of the annual risk of tuberculosis infection, the proportion of infections that lead to either of these diseases in unvaccinated children, the number of children vaccinated, and BCG efficacy. Findings: We estimated that the 100??5 million BCG vaccinations given to infants in 2002 will have prevented 29 729 cases of tuberculous meningitis (5th-95th centiles, 24 063-36 192) in children during their first 5 years of life, or one case for every 3435 vaccinations (2771-4177), and 11 486 cases of miliary tuberculosis (7304-16 280), or one case for every 9314 vaccinations (6172-13 729). The numbers of cases prevented would be highest in South East Asia (46{\%}), sub-Saharan Africa (27{\%}), the western Pacific region (15{\%}), and where the risk of tuberculosis infection and vaccine coverage are also highest. At US{\$}2-3 per dose, BCG vaccination costs US{\$}206 (150-272) per year of healthy life gained.

The paper also compares earnings penalties associated with over and under education across immigrant and minority ethnic groups for men and women. The results show that compared to Whites, Black African, Other Non-White and Indian men are more likely to be over-educated, whilst for women it is Indian and Pakistani/Bangladeshi's who are more likely to be over-educated. Estimating earnings equations shows significantly large over-education penalties for South Asian immigrant and native men, as well as White immigrant men, Black women and White UK born women. However, there are large returns to occupational skills for some minority ethnic and immigrant groups, over and above the returns to qualifications. It is suggested that these groups may therefore find it easier to find a suitable job for their UK education level if higher or further education programmes for immigrants were combined with occupational specific training. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The introduction and scale-up of new tools for the diagnosis of Tuberculosis (TB) in developing countries has the potential to make a huge difference to the lives of millions of people living in poverty. To achieve this, policy makers need the information to make the right decisions about which new tools to implement and where in the diagnostic algorithm to apply them most effectively. These decisions are difficult as the new tools are often expensive to implement and use, and the health system and patient impacts uncertain, particularly in developing countries where there is a high burden of TB. The authors demonstrate that a discrete event simulation model could play a significant part in improving and informing these decisions. The feasibility of linking the discrete event simulation to a dynamic epidemiology model is also explored in order to take account of longer term impacts on the incidence of TB. Results from two diagnostic districts in Tanzania are used to illustrate how the approach could be used to improve decisions.},

abstract = {SETTING: In-patient hospitals in South Africa and Uganda. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a lateral-flow urine lipoarabinomannan (LAM) test when added to existing strategies for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in human immunodeficiency virus infected adults (CD4(+) T-cell counts {\textless} 100 cells/l) with symptoms of active TB. DESIGN: Decision-analytic cost-utility model, with the primary outcome being the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio, expressed in 2010 US dollars per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted from the perspective of a public sector TB control program. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: For every 1000 patients tested, adding lateral-flow urine LAM generated 80 incremental appropriate anti-tuberculosis treatments and averted 224 DALYs. Estimated cost utility was US{\$}353 per DALY averted (95{\%} uncertainty range {\$}192{\$}1161) in South Africa and {\$}86 per DALY averted (95{\%} uncertainty range {\$}49{\$}239) in Uganda, reflecting the lower treatment costs in Uganda. Cost utility was most sensitive to assay specificity, cost of anti-tuberculosis treatment, life expectancy after TB cure and cohort TB prevalence, but did not rise above {\$}1500 per DALY averted in South Africa under any one-way sensitivity analysis. The probability of acceptability was {\textgreater}99.8{\%} at a per-DALY willingness-to-pay threshold equal to the per capita gross domestic product in South Africa ({\$}7275) and Uganda ({\$}509).},

When decisions must be made with only incomplete or preliminary data available, modelling is a useful tool for providing such guidance. Following a meeting of modelers and other key stakeholders organized by the TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium, we propose a conceptual framework for positioning models of TB diagnostics. We use that framework to describe modelling priorities in four key areas: Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF scale-up, target product profiles for novel assays, drug susceptibility testing to support new drug regimens, and the improvement of future TB diagnostic models. If we are to maximize the impact and cost-effectiveness of TB diagnostics, these modelling priorities should figure prominently as targets for future research.},

abstract = {Complex biological systems exhibit a property of robustness at all levels of organization. Through different mechanisms, the system tries to sustain stress such as due to starvation or drug exposure. To explore whether reconfiguration of the metabolic networks is used as a means to achieve robustness, we have studied possible metabolic adjustments in Mtb upon exposure to isoniazid (INH), a front-line clinical drug. The redundancy in the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) makes it an attractive system to explore if alternate routes of metabolism exist in the bacterium. While the mechanism of action of INH is well studied, its effect on the overall metabolism is not well characterized. Using flux balance analysis, inhibiting the fluxes flowing through the reactions catalyzed by Rv1484, the target of INH, significantly changes the overall flux profiles. At the pathway level, activation or inactivation of certain pathways distant from the target pathway, are seen. Metabolites such as NADPH are shown to reduce drastically, while fatty acids tend to accumulate. The overall biomass also decreases with increasing inhibition levels. Inhibition studies, pathway level clustering and comparison of the flux profiles with the gene expression data indicate the activation of folate metabolism, ubiquinone metabolism, and metabolism of certain amino acids. This analysis provides insights useful for target identification and designing strategies for combination therapy. Insights gained about the role of individual components of a system and their interactions will also provide a basis for reconstruction of whole systems through synthetic biology approaches.

In recent years, however, populations of human hosts have been increasing relatively rapidly, especially in many developing countries. In this paper we indicate how the framework of conventional compartmental models for microparasitic infections may be extended to include the effects of host population growth. We give both analytic and numerical illustrations of the ways in which the age-specific incidence of infection, the average age at infection, and other epidemiological quantities are likely to change over time in response to such overall growth in host population density. In particular, we show that the basic reproductive rate of the microparasite, R0, is to a good approximation given as R0{\{}reversed tilde equals{\}}B/A, where A is the average age at infection and B is the reciprocal of the birth rate. ?? 1985.},

abstract = {Molecular epidemiological studies can provide novel insights into the transmission of infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. Typically, risk factors for transmission are identified using traditional hypothesis-driven statistical methods such as logistic regression. However, limitations become apparent in these approaches as the scope of these studies expand to include additional epidemiological and bacterial genomic data. Here we examine the use of Bayesian models to analyze tuberculosis epidemiology. We begin by exploring the use of Bayesian networks (BNs) to identify the distribution of tuberculosis patient attributes (including demographic and clinical attributes). Using existing algorithms for constructing BNs from observational data, we learned a BN from data about tuberculosis patients collected in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999. We verified that the resulting probabilistic models did in fact capture known statistical relationships. Next, we examine the use of newly introduced methods for representing and automatically constructing probabilistic models in structured domains. We use statistical relational models (SRMs) to model distributions over relational domains. SRMs are ideally suited to richly structured epidemiological data. We use a data-driven method to construct a statistical relational model directly from data stored in a relational database. The resulting model reveals the relationships between variables in the data and describes their distribution. We applied this procedure to the data on tuberculosis patients in San Francisco from 1991 to 1999, their Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains, and data on contact investigations. The resulting statistical relational model corroborated previously reported findings and revealed several novel associations. These models illustrate the potential for this approach to reveal relationships within richly structured data that may not be apparent using conventional statistical approaches. We show that Bayesian methods, in particular statistical relational models, are an important tool for understanding infectious disease epidemiology.},

abstract = {Background: Substantial individual heterogeneity exists in the clinical manifestations and duration of active tuberculosis. We sought to link the individual-level characteristics of TB disease to observed population-level outcomes. Methods: We developed an individual-based, stochastic model of TB disease in a hypothetical cohort of patients with smear-positive TB. We conceptualized the disease process as consisting of two states - progression and recovery - including transitions between the two. We then used a Bayesian process to calibrate the model to clinical data from the pre-chemotherapy era, thus identifying the rates of progression and recovery (and probabilities of transition) consistent with observed population-level clinical outcomes. Results: Observed outcomes are consistent with slow rates of disease progression (median doubling time: 84 days, 95{\%} uncertainty range 62-104) and a low, but nonzero, probability of transition from disease progression to recovery (median 16{\%} per year, 95{\%} uncertainty range 11{\%}-21{\%}). Other individual-level dynamics were less influential in determining observed outcomes. Conclusions: This simplified model identifies individual-level dynamics - including a long doubling time and low probability of immune recovery - that recapitulate population-level clinical outcomes of untreated TB patients. This framework may facilitate better understanding of the population-level impact of interventions acting at the individual host level.},

The general multi-strain TB model is introduced as a fractional order multi-strain TB model. The fractional derivatives are described in the Caputo sense. An optimal control problem is formulated and studied theoretically using the Pontryagin maximum principle. Four controls variables are proposed to minimize the cost of interventions. Two simple-numerical methods are used to study the nonlinear fractional optimal control problem. The methods are the iterative optimal control method and the generalized Euler method. Comparative studies are implemented, and it is found that the iterative optimal control method is better than the generalized Euler method. Copyright (c) 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

Although asymptotic convergence of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms is ensured under weak assumptions, the performance of these algorithms is unreliable when the proposal distributions that are used to explore the space are poorly chosen and/or if highly correlated variables are updated independently. We show here how it is possible to build efficient high dimensional proposal distributions by using sequential Monte Carlo methods. This allows us not only to improve over standard Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes but also to make Bayesian inference feasible for a large class of statistical models where this was not previously so.

The results have indicated that the incidence in the area should stabilize around values of 20 new cases per year (per 100,000 population). A decrease in the incidence can be expected to occur only if the regimens so far employed are brought to a greater part of the patients' population (increasing coverage).

Model., 136, 103 – 112, 2001). In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of the same model by considering different parameters involved with the model as bifurcation param- eters in details. Considering the intrinsic growth rate of susceptible Tilapia fish as bifurcation parameter, we demonstrate the period doubling route to chaos. Next we consider the force of infection as bifurcation parameter and demonstrate the occurrence of two successive Hopf- bifurcations. We identify the existence of backward Hopf-bifurcation when the death rate of predators is considered as bifurcation parameter. Finally we construct a stochastic differential equation model corresponding to the deterministic model to understand the role of demographic stochasticity. Exhaustive numerical simulation of the stochastic model reveals the large ampli- tude fluctuation in the population of fish and Pelicans for certain parameter values. Extinction scenario for Pelicans is also captured from the stochastic model.},

abstract = {Background: Little is known about how long the BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis. We assessed the long-term vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Norwegian-born individuals. Methods: In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we studied Norwegian-born individuals aged 12-50 years who were tuberculin skin test (TST) negative and eligible for BCG vaccination as part of the last round of Norway's mandatory mass tuberculosis screening and BCG vaccination programme between 1962 and 1975. We excluded individuals who had tuberculosis before or in the year of screening and those with unknown TST and BCG status. We obtained TST and BCG information and linked it to the National Tuberculosis Register, population and housing censuses, and the population register for emigrations and deaths. We followed individuals up to their first tuberculosis episode, emigration, death, or Dec 31, 2011. We used Cox regressions to estimate VE against all tuberculosis and just pulmonary tuberculosis by time since vaccination, adjusted for age, time, county-level tuberculosis rates, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators. Findings: Median follow-up was 41 years (IQR 32-49) for 83 421 BCG-unvaccinated and 44 years (41-46) for 297 905 vaccinated individuals, with 260 tuberculosis episodes. Tuberculosis rates were 3??3 per 100 000 person-years in unvaccinated and 1??3 per 100 000 person-years in vaccinated individuals. The adjusted average VE during 40 year follow-up was 49{\%} (95{\%} CI 26-65), although after 20 years, the VE was not significant (up to 9 years VE [excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years] 61{\%} [95{\%} CI 24-80]; 10-19 years 58{\%} [27-76]; 20-29 years 38{\%} [-32 to 71]; 30-40 years 42{\%} [-24 to 73]). VE against pulmonary tuberculosis up to 9 years (excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years) was 67{\%} (95{\%} CI 27-85), 10-19 years was 63{\%} (32-80), 20-29 years was 50{\%} (-19 to 79), and 30-40 years was 40{\%} (-46 to 76). Interpretation: Findings are consistent with long-lasting BCG protection, but waning of VE with time. The vaccine could be more cost effective than has been previously estimated.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the economic benefits of a better tuberculosis (TB) vaccine by modeling prevented TB medical spending and lost productivity throughout the world. DESIGN: One model is based on benefits obtained from reducing the impact of TB on health spending. An alternative model is based on minimizing the impact of TB on health spending and lost productivity due to death and disability. Both models are applied to various world populations based on secondary data. RESULTS: In terms of avoided medical spending, preventing 100{\%} of the TB risk in a single individual is estimated to be worth from {\$}38 for males in formerly socialist countries to S0.23 for children in Asia. More than 1 billion people would reckon their expected medical savings to exceed {\$}25.00 if they received a 75{\%} effective vaccine of 10 years' duration. Preventing lost productivity is worth substantially more throughout the world. CONCLUSIONS: Improved TB vaccines would be of substantial immediate financial value to most of the populations of the world, including the poorest. The scientific uncertainties surrounding the development of a better vaccine could be a larger obstacle than investor uncertainty over whether a vaccine would be profitable.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Case detection by passive case finding (PCF) strategy alone is inadequate for detecting all tuberculosis (TB) cases in high burden settings especially Sub-Saharan Africa. Alternative case detection strategies such as community Active Case Finding (ACF) and Household Contact Investigations (HCI) are effective but empirical evidence of their cost-effectiveness is sparse. The objective of this study was to determine whether adding ACF or HCI compared with standard PCF alone represent cost-effective alternative TB case detection strategies in urban Africa. METHODS: A static decision modeling framework was used to examine the costs and effectiveness of three TB case detection strategies: PCF alone, PCF+ACF, and PCF+HCI. Probability and cost estimates were obtained from National TB program data, primary studies conducted in Uganda, published literature and expert opinions. The analysis was performed from the societal and provider perspectives over a 1.5 year time-frame. The main effectiveness measure was the number of true TB cases detected and the outcome was incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) expressed as cost in 2013 US{\$} per additional true TB case detected. RESULTS: Compared to PCF alone, the PCF+HCI strategy was cost-effective at US{\$}443.62 per additional TB case detected. However, PCF+ACF was not cost-effective at US{\$}1492.95 per additional TB case detected. Sensitivity analyses showed that PCF+ACF would be cost-effective if the prevalence of chronic cough in the population screened by ACF increased 10-fold from 4{\%} to 40{\%} and if the program costs for ACF were reduced by 50{\%}. CONCLUSIONS: Under our baseline assumptions, the addition of HCI to an existing PCF program presented a more cost-effective strategy than the addition of ACF in the context of an African city. Therefore, implementation of household contact investigations as a part of the recommended TB control strategy should be prioritized.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Extending the duration of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) among people living with HIV (PLHIV) may improve its effectiveness at both individual and population levels, but could also increase selective pressure in favor of isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis (TB) strains. The objective of this study was to determine the relative importance of these two effects. METHODS: Transmission dynamic model. DESIGN: We created a mathematical model of TB transmission incorporating HIV incidence and treatment, mixed strain latent TB infections, and four different phenotypes of TB drug resistance (pan-susceptible, isoniazid monoresistant, rifampicin monoresistant, and multidrug resistant). We used this model to project the effects of IPT duration on the incidence of isoniazid-sensitive and isoniazid-resistant TB as well as mortality among PLHIV. We evaluated the sensitivity of our baseline model, which was calibrated to data from Botswana, to different assumptions about the future trajectory of the TB epidemic. RESULTS: Our model suggests that, in the context of a declining TB epidemic such as that currently observed in Botswana, the incidence and mortality benefits of continuous IPT for PLHIV are likely to outweigh the potential resistance risks associated with long-duration IPT. However, should TB epidemics fail to remain in control, as was observed during the initial emergence of HIV, the selective pressure imposed by widespread use of continuous IPT on isoniazid-resistant TB incidence may erode its initial benefits. CONCLUSION: Resistance concerns are likely insufficient to rule out use of continuous IPT when coupled with effective TB treatment, case finding, and HIV control.},

abstract = {Measles epidemics in human populations exhibit what is perhaps the best empirically characterized, and certainly the most studied, stochastic persistence threshold in population biology. A critical community size (CCS) of around 250,000-500,000 separates populations where measles is predominantly persistent from smaller communities where there are frequent extinctions of measles between major epidemics. The fundamental mechanisms contributing to this pattern of persistence, which are long-lasting immunity to re-infection, recruitment of susceptibles, seasonality in transmission, age dependence of transmission and the spatial coupling between communities, have all been quantified and, to a greater or lesser level of success, captured by theoretical models. Despite these successes there has not been a consensus over whether simple models can successfully predict the value of the CCS, or indeed which mechanisms determine the persistence of measles over a broader range of population sizes. Specifically, the level of the CCS has been thought to be particularly sensitive to the detailed stochastic dynamics generated by the waiting time distribution (WTD) in the infectious and latent periods. We show that the relative patterns of persistence between models with different WTDs are highly sensitive to the criterion of comparison-in particular, the statistical measure of persistence that is employed. To this end, we introduce two new statistical measures of persistence-fade-outs post epidemic and fade-outs post invasion. Contrary to previous reports, we demonstrate that, no matter the choice of persistence measure, appropriately parametrized models of measles demonstrate similar predictions for the level of the CCS.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) control is especially difficult in settings of high HIV prevalence; HIV co-infection erodes host immunity and increases risk of progression to active TB. Studies have demonstrated that a 6-month (or longer) course of monotherapy with isoniazid [isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)] can reduce this risk. The World Health Organization endorses IPT for symptom-free individuals with HIV/TB co-infection and has recommended expanding IPT to entire communities (community-wide IPT). Although previous reviews have not found a statistically significant elevated risk of isoniazid-resistant TB among individuals previously treated with IPT, community-wide IPT programs may nonetheless generate substantial selective pressure and increase the burden of drug-resistant TB (DRTB). We developed mathematical models to identify the conditions under which community-wide IPT interventions could increase the burden of isoniazid-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis, even when we assumed that IPT does not select for resistance among those treated with IPT. We found that in models that included any mechanism of interstrain competition (such as partial immunity conferred by a previous M. tuberculosis infection), community-wide IPT interventions conferred an indirect benefit to drug-resistant strains through selective suppression of drug-sensitive infections. This result suggests that the absence of an observed elevation in the risk of DRTB among those receiving IPT in small-scale studies of limited duration does not imply that the selective pressure imposed by community-wide IPT will not be substantial. Community-wide IPT may play an important role in TB control in these settings, and its rollout should be accompanied by interventions to detect and treat drug-resistant disease.},

abstract = {SETTING: Standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is 9 months daily isoniazid (9INH). An alternative is 4 months daily rifampin (4RMP), associated with better completion and less toxicity; however, its efficacy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of these regimens for treating LTBI in human immunodeficiency virus negative persons, using results from a recent clinical trial, plus different scenarios for 4RMP efficacy, and to estimate the costs of an adequately powered noninferiority trial and resulting savings from substitution with 4RMP. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model tracked TB contacts and lower-risk tuberculin reactors receiving 9INH, 4RMP or no treatment. For different 4RMP efficacy scenarios, we estimated the cost-effectiveness, sample size and cost of non-inferiority trials, and potential cost savings substituting 4RMP for 9INH for 10 years in Canada. RESULTS: With an assumed 4RMP efficacy of 60{\%}, 9INH was more effective but slightly more expensive. Above a threshold efficacy of 69{\%}, 4RMP was cheaper and more effective than 9INH. If the true efficacy of 4RMP is {\textgreater}/=75{\%}, a trial powered to detect non-inferiority with a lower limit of 60{\%} estimated efficacy ({\~{}}20 000 subjects) may lead to cost savings within 10 years, even with the extreme assumption that Canada bears the entire cost. CONCLUSION: 4RMP may be a reasonable alternative to 9INH. Costs of a large-scale non-inferiority trial may be offset by subsequent savings.},

abstract = {Since 1985, there has been a renewed epidemic of tuberculosis (TB) that was previously thought to be in check. There is evidence to believe the main factor for this resurgence has been the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Co-infection with HIV and M. Tuberculosis has profound implications for the course of both diseases. This study represents a first attempt to understand how the introduction of an opportunistic infection, namely Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes TB, affects the dynamic interaction of HIV-1 and the immune system. We create a mathematical model using ordinary differential equations to describe the interaction of HIV and TB with the immune system. It is known that infection with TB can decrease the CD4(+) T cell counts-a key marker of AIDS progression; thus, it shortens survival in HIV infected individuals. Another main marker for HIV progression is the viral load. If this load is increased due to the presence of opportunistic infections, the disease progression is much more rapid. We also explore the effects of drug treatment on the TB infection in the doubly-infected patient.},

abstract = {The ubiquitous commensal bacteria harbour genes of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), often on conjugative plasmids. Antimicrobial use in food animals subjects their enteric commensals to antimicrobial pressure. A fraction of enteric Escherichia coli in cattle exhibit plasmid-gene mediated AMR to a third-generation cephalosporin ceftiofur. We adapted stochastic differential equations with diffusion approximation (a compartmental stochastic mathematical model) to research the sources and roles of stochasticity in the resistance dynamics, both during parenteral antimicrobial therapy and in its absence. The results demonstrated that demographic stochasticity among enteric E. coli in the occurrence of relevant events was important for the AMR dynamics only when bacterial numbers were depressed during therapy. However, stochasticity in the parameters of enteric E. coli ecology, whether externally or intrinsically driven, contributed to a wider distribution of the resistant E. coli fraction, both during therapy and in its absence, with stochasticities in individual parameters interacting in their contribution.},

The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, when a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibrium points when the associated basic reproduction number (R-0) is less than unity. Analyzing the model obviously reveals that exogenous reinfection plays a key role on the existence of backward bifurcation. However, an analysis of the ranges of exogenous reinfection suggested that backward bifurcation occurs only for very high and unrealistic ranges of the exogenous reinfection rate. Random perturbation of reinfection rates was performed to gain insight into the role of this latter on the stability of the disease free equilibrium. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on tuberculosis transmission given the complex contextual factors that can lead to patient loss before diagnosis or treatment. METHODS: An epidemic model of tuberculosis specifying discrete steps along the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway was constructed. The model was calibrated to the epidemiology of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United Republic of Tanzania and was used to assess the impact of a new diagnostic tool with 70{\%} sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. The influence of contextual factors on the projected epidemic impact of the new diagnostic tool over the decade following introduction was explored. FINDINGS: With the use of smear microscopy, the incidence of tuberculosis will decline by an average of 3.94{\%} per year. If the new tool is added, incidence will decline by an annual 4.25{\%}. This represents an absolute change of 0.31 percentage points (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.04-0.42). However, the annual decline in transmission with use of the new tool is less when existing strategies for the diagnosis of smear-negative cases have high sensitivity and when symptomatic individuals delay in seeking care. Other influential contextual factors include access to tuberculosis care, patient loss before diagnosis, initial patient default after diagnosis and treatment success rate. CONCLUSION: When implementing and scaling up the use of a new diagnostic tool, the operational context in which diagnosis and treatment take place needs to be considered.},

All are well-suited to current computer hardware. Two examples are given and developed throughout, one a linear three-element windkessel model of the human arterial system, the other a nonlinear Lorenz '96 model.

abstract = {Mathematical models have facilitated our understanding of infectious diseases dynamics and proved useful tools to compare control scenarios when interventional studies are not feasible or ethical. Here, we summarize evidence linking social, economic and biologic determinants to tuberculosis (TB) and review modeling approaches that have been used to understand their contribution to the epidemic dynamics of TB. Specifically, we find evidence for associations between smoking, indoor air pollution, diabetes mellitus, alcohol, nutritional status, crowding, migration, aging and economic trends, and the occurrence of TB infection and/or disease. We outline some methodological problems inherent to the study of these associations; these include study design issues, reverse causality and misclassification of both exposure and outcomes. We then go on to review two existing approaches to modeling the impact of determinants and the effect of interventions: the population attributable fraction model, which estimates the proportion of the TB burden that would be averted if exposure to a risk factor were eliminated from the population, and deterministic epidemic models that capture transmission dynamics and the indirect effects of interventions. We conclude by defining research priorities in both the study of specific determinants and the development of appropriate models to assess the impact of addressing these determinants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prisons of the former Soviet Union (FSU) have high rates of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) and are thought to drive general population tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. Effective prison case detection, though employing more expensive technologies, may reduce long-term treatment costs and slow MDR-TB transmission. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic transmission model of TB and drug resistance matched to the epidemiology and costs in FSU prisons. We evaluated eight strategies for TB screening and diagnosis involving, alone or in combination, self-referral, symptom screening, mass miniature radiography (MMR), and sputum PCR with probes for rifampin resistance (Xpert MTB/RIF). Over a 10-y horizon, we projected costs, quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), and TB and MDR-TB prevalence. Using sputum PCR as an annual primary screening tool among the general prison population most effectively reduced overall TB prevalence (from 2.78{\%} to 2.31{\%}) and MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74{\%} to 0.63{\%}), and cost US{\$}543/QALY for additional QALYs gained compared to MMR screening with sputum PCR reserved for rapid detection of MDR-TB. Adding sputum PCR to the currently used strategy of annual MMR screening was cost-saving over 10 y compared to MMR screening alone, but produced only a modest reduction in MDR-TB prevalence (from 0.74{\%} to 0.69{\%}) and had minimal effect on overall TB prevalence (from 2.78{\%} to 2.74{\%}). Strategies based on symptom screening alone were less effective and more expensive than MMR-based strategies. Study limitations included scarce primary TB time-series data in FSU prisons and uncertainties regarding screening test characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: In prisons of the FSU, annual screening of the general inmate population with sputum PCR most effectively reduces TB and MDR-TB prevalence, doing so cost-effectively. If this approach is not feasible, the current strategy of annual MMR is both more effective and less expensive than strategies using self-referral or symptom screening alone, and the addition of sputum PCR for rapid MDR-TB detection may be cost-saving over time.},

abstract = {The emergence of antibiotic resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis has raised the concern that pathogen strains that are virtually untreatable may become widespread. The acquisition of resistance to antibiotics results in a longer duration of infection in a host, but this resistance may come at a cost through a decreased transmission rate. This raises the question of whether the overall fitness of drug-resistant strains is higher than that of sensitive strains--essential information for predicting the spread of the disease. Here, we directly estimate the transmission cost of drug resistance, the rate at which resistance evolves, and the relative fitness of resistant strains. These estimates are made by using explicit models of the transmission and evolution of sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis, using approximate Bayesian computation, and molecular epidemiology data from Cuba, Estonia, and Venezuela. We find that the transmission cost of drug resistance relative to sensitivity can be as low as 10{\%}, that resistance evolves at rates of approximately 0.0025-0.02 per case per year, and that the overall fitness of resistant strains is comparable with that of sensitive strains. Furthermore, the contribution of transmission to the spread of drug resistance is very high compared with acquired resistance due to treatment failure (up to 99{\%}). Estimating such parameters directly from in vivo data will be critical to understanding and responding to antibiotic resistance. For instance, projections using our estimates suggest that the prevalence of tuberculosis may decline with successful treatment, but the proportion of cases associated with resistance is likely to increase.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a significant health problem in the Canadian Arctic. Substantial health system delays in TB diagnosis can occur, in part due to the lack of capacity for onsite microbiologic testing. A study recently evaluated the yield and impact of a rapid automated PCR test (Xpert(R)MTB/RIF) for the diagnosis of TB in Iqaluit (Nunavut). We conducted an economic analysis to evaluate the expected cost relative to the expected reduction in time to treatment initiation, with the addition of Xpert(R)MTB/RIF to the current diagnostic and treatment algorithms used in this setting. METHODS: A decision analysis model compared current microbiologic testing to a scenario where Xpert(R)MTB/RIF was added to the current diagnostic algorithm for active TB, and incorporated costs and clinical endpoints from the Iqaluit study. Several sensitivity analyses that considered alternative use were also considered. We estimated days to TB diagnosis and treatment initiation, health system costs, and the incremental cost per treatment day gained for each individual evaluated for possible TB. RESULTS: With the addition of Xpert(R)MTB/RIF, costs increased while days to TB treatment initiation were reduced. The incremental cost per treatment day gained (per individual investigated for TB) was {\$}164 (95{\%} uncertainty range {\$}85, {\$}452). In a sensitivity analysis that considered hospital discharge after a single negative Xpert(R)MTB/RIF, the Xpert(R)MTB/RIF scenario was cost saving. INTERPRETATION: Adding Xpert(R)MTB/RIF to the current diagnostic algorithm for TB in Nunavut appears to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment at reasonable cost. It may be especially well suited to overcome some of the other logistical barriers that are unique to this and other remote communities.},

abstract = {Background: Untargeted active screening and treatment programmes for tuberculosis (TB) have not been shown to be more effective than passive screening and isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for reducing TB incidence. In this manuscript, we compare the efficacy of targeting screening and IPT on high-risk household contacts of diagnosed TB cases, with less-targeted active screening approaches in Lima, Peru. Methods: We conducted a population-based prospective cohort study within households of TB cases in Lima. We identified all adults diagnosed with incident pulmonary TB from 2009 through 2012 at 106 participating public health centres (HC) within our catchment area of approximately 3.3 million inhabitants. We estimated combined effects of community and household exposure on the risk of latent TB infection (LTBI) and incident TB disease. We used simulation modelling to assess the efficacy of TB screening programmes for reducing the risk of incident TB in these contacts. Results: Individuals with household exposure to TB are more likely to present with LTBI and TB disease than those without this exposure, despite wide variation in community exposure. Simulations suggest that more cases are prevented by 1000 administrations of IPT to tuberculin skin test (TST)-positive household contacts of identified TB cases (30, 95{\%} CI = 16,47) than from blanket screening and treatment in the community (7, 95{\%} CI = 2,17). Conclusions: Household exposure remains a major driver of incident TB risk among household contacts of identified TB cases. Targeting interventions on these individuals is likely to prevent more cases of TB than blanket screening of individuals in the community.},

This study proposes a hybrid model combining autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) with a nonlinear autoregressive (NAR) neural network for forecasting the incidence of TB from January 2007 to March 2016. Prediction performance was compared between the hybrid model and the ARIMA model. The best-fit hybrid model was combined with an ARIMA (3,1,0) x (0,1,1)12 and NAR neural network with four delays and 12 neurons in the hidden layer. The ARIMA-NAR hybrid model, which exhibited lower mean square error, mean absolute error, and mean absolute percentage error of 0.2209, 0.1373, and 0.0406, respectively, in the modelling performance, could produce more accurate forecasting of TB incidence compared to the ARIMA model. This study shows that developing and applying the ARIMA-NAR hybrid model is an effective method to fit the linear and nonlinear patterns of time-series data, and this model could be helpful in the prevention and control of TB.},

abstract = {Evidence of preferential mixing through selected social routes has been suggested for the transmission of tuberculosis (TB) infection in low burden settings. A realistic modelization of these contact routes is needed to appropriately assess the impact of individually targeted control strategies, such as contact network investigation of index cases and treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI). We propose an age-structured, socio-demographic individual based model (IBM) with a realistic, time-evolving structure of preferential contacts in a population. In particular, transmission within households, schools and workplaces, together with a component of casual, distance-dependent contacts are considered. We also compared the model against two other formulations having no social structure of contacts (homogeneous mixing transmission): a baseline deterministic model without age structure and an age-structured IBM. The socio-demographic IBM better fitted recent longitudinal data on TB epidemiology in Arkansas, USA, which serves as an example of a low burden setting. Inclusion of age structure in the model proved fundamental to capturing actual proportions of reactivated TB cases (as opposed to recently transmitted) as well as profiling age-group specific incidence. The socio-demographic structure additionally provides a prediction of TB transmission rates (the rate of infection in household contacts and the rate of secondary cases in household and workplace contacts). These results suggest that the socio-demographic IBM is an optimal choice for evaluating current control strategies, including contact network investigation of index cases, and the simulation of alternative scenarios, particularly for TB eradication targets.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The development of a successful new tuberculosis (TB) vaccine would circumvent many limitations of current diagnostic and treatment practices. However, vaccine development is complex and costly. We aimed to assess the potential cost effectiveness of novel vaccines for TB control in a sub-Saharan African country--Zambia--relative to the existing strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS) and current level of bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination coverage. METHODS: We conducted a decision analysis model-based simulation from the societal perspective, with a 3{\%} discount rate and all costs expressed in 2007 US dollars. Health outcomes and costs were projected over a 30-year period, for persons born in Zambia (population 11,478,000 in 2005) in year 1. Initial development costs for single vaccination and prime-boost strategies were prorated to the Zambian share (0.398{\%}) of global BCG vaccine coverage for newborns. Main outcome measures were TB-related morbidity, mortality, and costs over a range of potential scenarios for vaccine efficacy. RESULTS: Relative to the status quo strategy, a BCG replacement vaccine administered at birth, with 70{\%} efficacy in preventing rapid progression to TB disease after initial infection, is estimated to avert 932 TB cases and 422 TB-related deaths (prevention of 199 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and 90 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). This would result in estimated net savings of {\$}3.6 million over 30 years for 468,073 Zambians born in year 1 of the simulation. The addition of a booster at age 10 results in estimated savings of {\$}5.6 million compared to the status quo, averting 1,863 TB cases and 1,011 TB-related deaths (prevention of 398 cases/100,000 vaccinated, and of 216 deaths/100,000 vaccinated). With vaccination at birth alone, net savings would be realized within 1 year, whereas the prime-boost strategy would require an additional 5 years to realize savings, reflecting a greater initial development cost. CONCLUSIONS: Investment in an improved TB vaccine is predicted to result in considerable cost savings, as well as a reduction in TB morbidity and TB-related mortality, when added to existing control strategies. For a vaccine with waning efficacy, a prime-boost strategy is more cost-effective in the long term.},

abstract = {In this thesis, a mathematical model describing the interaction between HIV and TB in the presence of TB superinfection is presented. The model takes into account two strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), where one strain is drug-sensitive and the other is resistant to at least one of the first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. The impact of TB superinfection on the incidence and prevalence of TB in HIV-negative and HIVTB coinfected individuals is evaluated. Various control measures such as condom use, antiretroviral therapy, isoniazid preventive therapy and increased TB detection are studied using this model. Numerical results show that TB superinfection increases the prevalence and incidence of TB and its impact is more in HIV-negative than HIV-TB coinfected individuals. The results also show that TB superinfection promotes strain coexistence and increases the associated HIV mortality. Increased condom use was found to have a high positive impact towards the control of the two epidemics. Antiretroviral therapy decreases the TB notification rate and its impact on HIV prevalence increases with the coverage and efficacy. Isoniazid preventive therapy has a clear effect on the TB prevalence. Finally, increased TB detection was found to have a less impact on the TB incidence in HIV-TB coinfected individuals},

In unvaccinated mice, the influence of Treg in the control of primary infection with mycobacteria remains controversial.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: Here, we evaluated the role of Treg during prophylactic vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin) on the induction of T cell responses and on the protective effect against subsequent M. tuberculosis challenge in mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nPRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We demonstrated that, subsequent to BCG injection, Treg were recruited to the draining lymph nodes and negatively control anti-mycobacterial CD4(+)--but not CD8(+)--T-cell responses. Treatment of BCG-immunized mice with an anti-CD25 mAb (PC61) induced an increase IFN-gamma response against both subdominant and immunodominant regions of the protective immunogen TB10.4. In Treg-attenuated, BCG-immunized mice, which were then infected with M. tuberculosis, the lung mycobacterial load was significantly, albeit moderately, reduced compared to the control mice.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Our results provide the first demonstration that attenuation of Treg subset concomitant to BCG vaccination has a positive, yet limited, impact on the protective capacity of this vaccine against infection with M. tuberculosis. Thus, for rational design of improved BCG, it should be considered that, although the action of Treg does not represent the major cause of the limited efficiency of BCG, the impact of this cell population on the subsequent control of M. tuberculosis growth is significant and measurable.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of the current Irish programme of universal BCG vaccination of infants versus a programme which considered selectively vaccinating high risk infants using decision analytical modelling. METHODS The efficacy of the BCG vaccine was re-evaluated to inform a decision analytical model constructed to follow a birth cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated infants over a 15 year time horizon. The number of life years gained (LYG) was the primary outcome measure and this was compared to the net cost of the vaccination strategies. RESULTS In the base case analysis, the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the universal strategy and selective strategy vs no vaccination were €204,373/LYG and €143,233/LYG respectively. When comparing the incremental difference in moving from the universal to the selective strategy, the selective strategy costs €1,055,692 less per 4.8 life years lost per birth cohort. One way sensitivity analyses highlighted that a move from the universal to the selective strategy was particularly sensitive to the estimate of vaccine efficacy against deaths, the cost of administering the vaccine and the multiplier used to apportion risk of contracting tuberculosis. Probabilistic analysis suggested that a move from a universal based strategy to a selective based strategy could be deemed cost effective (probability of cost effectiveness is 76.8 {\%}). CONCLUSION The results of the study support the protective effect of the BCG vaccine in infants and quantified the cost effectiveness of the current BCG vaccination strategy and the decremental difference in moving to a selective strategy. This analysis highlights that the additional protection offered by the universal vaccination strategy is small compared to that of the selective strategy. Consideration should therefore be given to the implementation of a selective vaccination strategy, and diverting resources to improve TB case management and control.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Kenya is heralded as an example of declining HIV in Africa, while its tuberculosis (TB) numbers continue rising. We conducted a comparative investigation of TB-HIV co-dynamics in Africa to determine the likelihood of reported trends. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our mathematical modeling analysis exposes the notable incongruence of reported trends in Kenya because TB-HIV co-dynamics, tightly knit worldwide and most dramatically in sub-Saharan Africa, suggest that declining HIV trends should trigger reductions in TB trends. Moreover, a continental-scale analysis of TB-HIV trends places Kenya as an outlier in eastern and southern Africa, and shows TB outpacing HIV in western central Africa. We further investigate which TB processes across HIV stages have greater potential to reduce TB incidence via a sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: There are two parsimonious explanations: an unaccounted improvement in TB case detection has occurred, or HIV is not declining as reported. The TB-HIV mismatch could be compounded by surveillance biases due to spatial heterogeneity in disease dynamics. Results highlight the need to re-evaluate trends of both diseases in Kenya, and identify the most critical epidemiological factors at play. Substantial demographic changes have occurred in Kenya, including rapid urbanization accompanied by poor living conditions, which could disproportionately increase TB incidence. Other possible contributors include immune reconstitution due to the recent delivery of antiretrovirals, and an increased presence of the virulent Beijing/W TB genotype. Results support the importance of integrating information from closely interacting epidemics, because this approach provides critical insights unobtainable when components of generalized epidemics are considered individually.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate tuberculosis (TB) incidence and case detection rate (CDR) using routine TB surveillance data only. METHODS: A mathematical model of the case detection process, representing competition between disease progression and case finding, is proposed. The model describes disease progression as a two-stage process (bacillary and non-bacillary TB), and so relates the proportion of bacillary TB cases on detection to the effectiveness of detection. Thus, given the annual numbers of newly detected TB cases stratified by bacillary status, the model estimates detection rates, incidence and CDR. Routine notification data from eight provinces in Russia, 2000-2011, were used for the study. RESULTS: Subnational level estimates of incidence and CDR were obtained. Incidence estimates varied by two-fold among the provinces; corrected CDR estimates varied by 1.5 times. The trend in the incidence estimates was similar to that in the World Health Organization estimates for the whole of Russia. The change in the trend in WHO CDR estimates in 2008-2009 was not supported by our estimates. CONCLUSION: The general approach that uses multistage models of disease progression and accordingly stratified notification data can be applied in various settings for the routine estimation of incidence and CDR.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nearly 20,000 people were diagnosed with multi-drug and rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis (MDR/RR-TB) in South Africa in 2015, yet only one-half of the patients who start treatment are expected to have a successful outcome. There is increasing evidence of the effectiveness and safety of new drug regimens containing bedaquiline for MDR/RR-TB; however, whether they are affordable for high-burden, limited-resource settings is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to determine the incremental cost effectiveness of a bedaquiline-based regimen for MDR/RR-TB treatment in South Africa compared with the standard kanamycin-based regimen. METHODS: We established a Markov model for ambulatory treatment of MDR/RR-TB in a high-HIV prevalence setting, parameterized using clinical outcomes from the South African National TB Programme (SA NTP) before (2012-2014) and after (2015-2016) bedaquiline roll-out. The effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs). Ingredient costs from the provider's perspective were collected in 2016 South African Rand and converted to {\$}US, including bedaquiline at {\$}US675.23 per 6-month treatment course. Culture conversion rates were derived from the phase IIb trial of bedaquiline, and disability adjustments were adapted from published literature. Costs and effectiveness were discounted at 3{\%}. RESULTS: For non-bedaquiline regimens, the total expected cost over the 10-year time horizon for a patient with MDR/RR-TB was {\$}US4439 with disability-adjusted survival of 5.1 years. Replacing capreomycin with bedaquiline in patients who failed MDR/RR-TB treatment and required treatment for extensively drug-resistant (XDR-TB) resulted in cost savings ({\$}US4356; 1.8{\%} less) and similar effectiveness (0.02 DALYs averted). As a result, the standard regimen (no bedaquiline) was dominated. Replacing kanamycin with bedaquiline to provide all patients with MDR/RR-TB access to bedaquiline cost {\$}US4647 (4.3{\%} more) and averted 0.17 DALYs compared with the no bedaquiline regimen. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was {\$}US1242/DALY averted. CONCLUSION: Markov modelling indicates providing bedaquiline for all patients with MDR/RR-TB could increase the 24-month treatment success rate in South Africa from 56.3{\%} using the current regimen to 60.6{\%}, at a cost {\$}US2.6 million over a 10-year horizon, less than 1{\%} of the estimated {\$}US425 million SA NTP annual budget.},

@article{Mills2011,
abstract = {Individuals living with HIV experience a much higher risk of progression from latent M. tuberculosis infection to active tuberculosis (TB) disease relative to individuals with intact immune systems. A several-month daily course of a single drug during latent infection (i.e. isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT)) has proved in clinical trials to substantially reduce an HIV-infected individual's risk of TB disease. As a result of these findings and ongoing studies, the World Health Organization has produced strong guidelines for implementing IPT on a community-wide scale for individuals with HIV at risk of TB disease. To date, there has been limited use of IPT at a community-wide level. In this paper, we present a new co-network model for HIV and TB co-epidemics to address questions about how the population-level impact of community-wide IPT may differ from the individual-level impact of IPT offered to selected individuals. In particular, we examine how the effect of clustering of contacts within high-TB incidence communities may affect the rates of re-infection with TB and how this clustering modifies the expected population-level effects of IPT. We find that populations with clustering of respiratory contacts experience aggregation of TB cases and high numbers of re-infection events. While, encouragingly, the overall population-level effects of community-wide IPT appear to be sustained regardless of network structure, we find that in populations where these contacts are highly clustered, there is dramatic heterogeneity in the impact of IPT: in some sub-regions of these populations, TB is nearly eliminated, while in others, repeated re-infection almost completely undermines the effect of IPT. Our findings imply that as IPT programmes are brought to scale, we should expect local heterogeneity of effectiveness as a result of the complex patterns of disease transmission within communities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) in prisons is a major health problem in countries of high and intermediate TB endemicity such as Brazil. For operational reasons, TB control strategies in prisons cannot be compared through population based intervention studies. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A mathematical model is proposed to simulate the TB dynamics in prison and evaluate the potential impact on active TB prevalence of several intervention strategies. The TB dynamics with the ongoing program was simulated over a 10 year period in a Rio de Janeiro prison (TB prevalence 4.6 {\%}). Then, a simulation of the DOTS strategy reaching the objective of 70 {\%} of bacteriologically-positive cases detected and 85 {\%} of detected cases cured was performed; this strategy reduced only to 2.8{\%} the average predicted TB prevalence after 5 years. Adding TB detection at entry point to DOTS strategy had no major effect on the predicted active TB prevalence. But, adding further a yearly X-ray mass screening of inmates reduced the predicted active TB prevalence below 1{\%}. Furthermore, according to this model, after applying this strategy during 2 years (three annual screenings), the TB burden would be reduced and the active TB prevalence could be kept at a low level by associating X-ray screening at entry point and DOTS. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We have shown that X-ray mass screenings should be considered to control TB in highly endemic prison. Prisons with different levels of TB prevalence could be examined thanks to this model which provides a rational tool for public health deciders.},

Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {Decisions on how to mitigate an evolving pandemic are technically challenging. We present a real-time assessment of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative influenza A/H1N1v vaccination strategies. A transmission dynamic model was fitted to the estimated number of cases in real-time, and used to generate plausible autumn scenarios under different vaccination options. The proportion of these cases by age and risk group leading to primary care consultations, National Pandemic Flu Service consultations, emergency attendances, hospitalisations, intensive care and death was then estimated using existing data from the pandemic. The real-time model suggests that the epidemic will peak in early November, with the peak height being similar in magnitude to the summer wave. Vaccination of the high-risk groups is estimated to prevent about 45 deaths (80{\%} credibility interval 26-67), and save around 2900 QALYs (80{\%} credibility interval 1600-4500). Such a programme is very likely to be cost-effective if the cost of vaccine purchase itself is treated as a sunk cost. Extending vaccination to low-risk individuals is expected to result in more modest gains in deaths and QALYs averted. Extending vaccination to school-age children would be the most cost-effective extension. The early availability of vaccines is crucial in determining the impact of such extensions. There have been a considerable number of cases of H1N1v in England, and so the benefits of vaccination to mitigate the ongoing autumn wave are limited. However, certain groups appear to be at significantly higher risk of complications and deaths, and so it appears both effective and cost-effective to vaccinate them. The United Kingdom was the first country to have a major epidemic in Europe. In countries where the epidemic is not so far advanced vaccination of children may be cost-effective. Similar, detailed, real-time modelling and economic studies could help to clarify the situation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Technologies for strain differentiation and typing have made it possible to detect genetic diversity of pathogens, both within individual hosts and within communities. Coinfection of a host by more than one pathogen strain may affect the relative frequency of these strains at the population level through complex within- and between-host interactions; in infectious diseases that have a long latent period, interstrain competition during latency is likely to play an important role in disease dynamics. We show that SEIR models that include a class of latently coinfected individuals can have markedly different long-term dynamics than models without coinfection, and that coinfection can greatly facilitate the stable coexistence of strains. We demonstrate these dynamics using a model relevant to tuberculosis in which people may experience latent coinfection with both drug sensitive and drug resistant strains. Using this model, we show that the existence of a latent coinfected state allows the possibility that disease control interventions that target latency may facilitate the emergence of drug resistance.},

Using traditional approaches, control of tuberculosis in this population has been difficult. Decision analysis was used to investigate the cost-effectiveness of BCG (bacillus Calmette-Guerin) vaccination in persons attending homeless shelters. This vaccination was cost-effective over a wide range of assumptions. Using conservative assumptions, a vaccine that was at least 40 percent effective would result in a net cost savings. If the efficacy of the vaccine were 50 percent, {\$}4,000 would be saved, 12 life-years gained, and 23 cases of active tuberculosis prevented for every 1,000 persons vaccinated. Further study of the BCG vaccine in homeless persons and other populations at risk is warranted.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a major source of global mortality caused by infection, partly because of a tremendous ongoing burden of undiagnosed disease. Improved diagnostic technology may play an increasingly crucial part in global efforts to end tuberculosis, but the ability of diagnostic tests to curb tuberculosis transmission is dependent on multiple factors, including the time taken by a patient to seek health care, the patient's symptoms, and the patterns of transmission before diagnosis. Novel diagnostic assays for tuberculosis have conventionally been evaluated on the basis of characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, using assumptions that probably overestimate the impact of diagnostic tests on transmission. We argue for a shift in focus to the evaluation of such tests' incremental value, defining outcomes that reflect each test's purpose (for example, transmissions averted) and comparing systems with the test against those without, in terms of those outcomes. Incremental value can also be measured in units of outcome per incremental unit of resource (for example, money or human capacity). Using a novel, simplified model of tuberculosis transmission that addresses some of the limitations of earlier tuberculosis diagnostic models, we demonstrate that the incremental value of any novel test depends not just on its accuracy, but also on elements such as patient behaviour, tuberculosis natural history and health systems. By integrating these factors into a single unified framework, we advance an approach to the evaluation of new diagnostic tests for tuberculosis that considers the incremental value at the population level and demonstrates how additional data could inform more-effective implementation of tuberculosis diagnostic tests under various conditions.This article has not been written or reviewed by Nature editors.

abstract = {This paper documents and attempts to explain the epidemic spread of tuberculosis (TB) in Russia during the 1990s. After several decades of decline, the notification rate of all new TB cases among permanent residents increased by 7.5{\%} per year from 1991-1999 and the death rate by 11{\%} per year. Growth was quickest from 1993-1995 but increased again after the economic crisis of August 1998. Approximately 120 000 new cases and 30 000 deaths were reported in 1999. Case detection and cure rates have fallen in Russia since the mid-1980s; the fall has been accompanied by a higher frequency of severe disease among cases, and higher death and case fatality rates. With a mathematical model describing the deterioration in case finding and cure rates we could replicate the average rate of increase in incidence 1991-1999 but not the precise timing of the observed changes. Other factors that probably helped to shape the observed rise in caseload include enhanced transmission due to the mixing of prison and civilian populations, an increase in susceptibility to disease, and changes in the proportion of cases detected by surveillance. Although our explanation for the resurgence of TB is incomplete, we have identified a set of measures that can be implemented now to cut transmission, incidence and deaths.},

@article{Pharoah1996a,
abstract = {In the United Kingdom, BCG immunization of neonates provides good protection against military and meningeal disease, and probably against other forms of tuberculosis, in all ethnic groups. Serious adverse reactions to BCG immunization are rare. Cost-effectiveness studies of BCG immunization in neonates have not been reported, and 'universal' BCG immunization is not recommended in the United Kingdom. The Department of Health does recommend immunization for children and infants of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. There are problems associated with such a 'selective' policy, as determining what is 'high' prevalence and thus defining 'at risk' groups is difficult, and there may be political and practical difficulties in its implementation. This may result in low coverage in eligible groups. A 'universal' policy of BCG immunization for all neonates may be politically more acceptable and easier to implement in districts with high tuberculosis notification rates. Although there is no cost-effectiveness data to determine at what tuberculosis notification rate a universal policy should be adopted, an universal policy has been suggested for districts with overall notification rate of greater than 40 per 100,000. Within districts there may be large variations in tuberculosis notification rates between different areas. This is becoming more common with the amalgamation and merger of smaller districts into new larger purchasing organizations. New River Health Authority is such a district formed by the amalgamation of the former districts of Haringey with a high tuberculosis notification rate, and Enfield with a lower TB notification rate. In order to maximize coverage in the 'at risk' neonates, a different neonatal BCG policy has been adopted in the two areas. This has been possible because of the flexibility of the mechanisms for contracting with different provider units. Although the overall notification rate was not thought to be sufficiently high to justify a 'universal' neonatal policy throughout the district, a 'universal' policy has been instituted in the main provider unit in the former district Haringey. A 'selective' policy, subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure high coverage, continues to be operated by the main provider unit in the former district of Enfield.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Formulation and evaluation of public health policy commonly employs science-based mathematical models. For instance, epidemiological dynamics of TB is dominated, in general, by flow between actively and latently infected populations. Thus modelling is central in planning public health intervention. However, models are highly uncertain because they are based on observations that are geographically and temporally distinct from the population to which they are applied. AIMS: We aim to demonstrate the advantages of info-gap theory, a non-probabilistic approach to severe uncertainty when worst cases cannot be reliably identified and probability distributions are unreliable or unavailable. Info-gap is applied here to mathematical modelling of epidemics and analysis of public health decision-making. METHODS: Applying info-gap robustness analysis to tuberculosis/HIV (TB/HIV) epidemics, we illustrate the critical role of incorporating uncertainty in formulating recommendations for interventions. Robustness is assessed as the magnitude of uncertainty that can be tolerated by a given intervention. We illustrate the methodology by exploring interventions that alter the rates of diagnosis, cure, relapse and HIV infection. RESULTS: We demonstrate several policy implications. Equivalence among alternative rates of diagnosis and relapse are identified. The impact of initial TB and HIV prevalence on the robustness to uncertainty is quantified. In some configurations, increased aggressiveness of intervention improves the predicted outcome but also reduces the robustness to uncertainty. Similarly, predicted outcomes may be better at larger target times, but may also be more vulnerable to model error. CONCLUSIONS: The info-gap framework is useful for managing model uncertainty and is attractive when uncertainties on model parameters are extreme. When a public health model underlies guidelines, info-gap decision theory provides valuable insight into the confidence of achieving agreed-upon goals.},

The risk for TB infection greatly increases with HIV infection; TB disease occurs in 7-10{\%} of patients with HIV infection each year, increasing the potential for transmission of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. In this paper a deterministic model is presented and studied for the transmission of TB-HIV/AIDS co-infection. Optimal control theory is then applied to investigate optimal strategies for controlling the spread of the disease using treatment of infected individuals with TB as the system control variables. Various combination strategies were examined so as to investigate the impact of the controls on the spread of the disease. And incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was used to investigate the cost effectiveness of all the control strategies. Our results show that the implementation of the combination strategy involving the prevention of treatment failure in drug-sensitive TB infectious individuals and the treatment of individuals with drug-resistant TB is the most cost-effective control strategy. Similar results were obtained with different objective functionals involving the minimization of the number of individuals with drug-sensitive TB-only and drug-resistant TB-only with the efforts involved in applying the control.},

@article{Dowdy2013,
abstract = {Rationale: Tuberculosis (TB) is characterized by a subclinical phase (symptoms absent or not considered abnormal); prediagnostic phase (symptoms noticed but diagnosis not pursued); and clinical phase (care actively sought). Diagnostic capacity during these phases is limited. Objectives: To estimate the population-level impact of TB case-finding strategies in the presence of subclinical and prediagnostic disease. Methods: We created a mathematical epidemic model of TB, calibrated to global incidence. We then introduced three prototypical diagnostic interventions: increased sensitivity of diagnosis in the clinical phase by 20{\%} ("passive"); early diagnosis during the prediagnostic phase at a rate of 10{\%} per year ("enhanced"); and population-based diagnosis of 5{\%} of undiagnosed prevalent cases per year ("active"). Measurements and Main Results: If the subclinical phase was ignored, as in most models, the passive strategy was projected to reduce TB incidence by 18{\%} (90{\%} uncertainty range [UR], 11-32{\%}) by year 10, compared with 23{\%} (90{\%} UR, 14-35{\%}) for the enhanced strategy and 18{\%} (90{\%} UR, 11-28{\%}) for the active strategy. After incorporating a subclinical phase into the model, consistent with population-based prevalence surveys, the active strategy still reduced 10-year TB incidence by 16{\%} (90{\%} UR, 11-28{\%}), but the passive and enhanced strategies' impact was attenuated to 11{\%} (90{\%} UR, 8-25{\%}) and 6{\%} (90{\%} UR, 4-13{\%}), respectively. The degree of attenuation depended strongly on the transmission rate during the subclinical phase. Conclusions: Subclinical disease may limit the impact of current diagnostic strategies for TB. Active detection of undiagnosed prevalent cases may achieve greater population-level TB control than increasing passive case detection.},

abstract = {Modulation of host metabolic machinery by Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a well established phenomenon. In our earlier study (Mehrotra et al., 2014), we observed a marked increase in acetyl-CoA levels in cells bearing virulent M. tuberculosis infections compared to host cells harbouring avirulent infections. The difference was observed inspite of similar levels of total host cellular pyruvate in both infection types. The present study aimed in capturing the cause for such a phenomenon that defines the pathogenicity of M. tuberculosis. Through mathematical model, we dissected the relative importance of virulence mediated effect on Pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) activity, rate of acetyl-CoA consumption and mitochondrial pyruvate transporter (MPC) activity in causing the observed outcomes. Simulation results exhibit MPC to be the key regulatory junction perturbed by virulent strains of M. tuberculosis leading to alteration of mitochondrial metabolic flux and regulation of acetyl-CoA formation. As an experimental validation, drug mediated inhibition of MPC activity was sufficient to reduce virulent bacillary loads, pointing towards a possible mechanistic target for drug discovery.},

The cumulative incidence of tuberculosis before 5 years of age was estimated among children born in Sweden during periods of high, low and moderate increasing BCG coverage. The incidence figures per 100 000 children was 0.8, 3.9 and 2.9, respectively, for children born to Swedish parents and 2.6, 39.4 and 13.2, respectively, for those born to foreign parents. The observed incidence of tuberculosis among non-BCG vaccinated children born to Swedish parents was within the expected limits given by a prognostic model based on the natural change of the risk of infection. The effectiveness of the selective BCG vaccination programme, which was intensified after 1981 for the second generation of immigrants, was estimated to 0.82 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.38, 0.95) assuming that there was no change of the risk of infection for children born to foreign parents over the period studied.

We use mathematical models to predict the potential public health impact of new TB vaccines in high-incidence countries.

Postexposure vaccines would initially have a substantially greater impact, compared to preexposure vaccines, on reducing the number of new cases of disease. However, the effectiveness of postexposure vaccines would diminish over time, whereas the effectiveness of preexposure vaccines would increase. Thus, after 20 to 30 years, post- or preexposure vaccination campaigns would be almost equally effective in terms of cumulative TB cases prevented. Even widely deployed and highly effective (50{\%}-90{\%} efficacy) pre- or postexposure vaccines would only be able to reduce the number of TB cases by one third.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isoniazid prophylaxis for 12 months effectively prevents tuberculosis in HIV-infected persons and may decrease the incidence of other HIV-related disease and mortality. Recent clinical trials have found that some short-course regimens also effectively prevent tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness of isoniazid prophylaxis and short-course prophylaxis regimens. DESIGN: Decision and cost-effectiveness analysis. SETTING: United States. PATIENTS: Hypothetical patients who are HIV-infected and have CD4 counts of 200 cells/mm3 or less and positive results on tuberculin skin tests. INTERVENTIONS: Isoniazid prophylaxis lasting 12 months and six short-course prophylaxis regimens of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide alone or in combination. MEASUREMENTS: 5-year survival rate, life expectancy, lifetime incidence of tuberculosis, and cost per quality-adjusted life-year saved. RESULTS: Compared with no prophylaxis, the 12-month isoniazid regimen increased 5-year survival rates by 9{\%} and life expectancy by 8.7 months, decreased incidence of tuberculosis by 27{\%}, and saved 4 medical care dollars for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. Regimens of isoniazid for 6 months, isoniazid and rifampin for 3 months, and rifampin and pyrazinamide for 2 months had similar results: 6.2- to 8.6-month increases in life expectancy, 19{\%} to 26{\%} reductions in incidence of tuberculosis, and 1 to 7 medical care dollars saved for every 1 spent on prophylaxis. A 3-month regimen of isoniazid, rifampin, and pyrazinamide resulted in fewer clinical benefits and was the only regimen tested that did not save medical care dollars. CONCLUSIONS: Prophylaxis decreases the incidence of tuberculosis and increases life expectancy for HIV-infected patients. Some regimens save medical care dollars, and some short-course regimens have clinical and economic benefits similar to those of the 12-month isoniazid regimen. Short-course prophylaxis is a reasonable alternative to the 12-month isoniazid regimen.},

OUTCOMES: Marginal cost-effectiveness ratios (2010 US dollars) with effectiveness measured as quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). RESULTS: At an LTBI prevalence of 1.1{\%} (the average US childhood prevalence in our base case), a no-screening strategy dominated ({\$}2,201; 29.3356 QALYs) targeted screening ({\$}2,218; 29.3356 QALYs) and universal TST ({\$}2,481; 29.3347 QALYs).

In the secondary model, targeted screening with a questionnaire followed by IGRA testing was cost-effective compared with no screening in the base case when the LTBI prevalence was {\textgreater}4.9{\%}. LIMITATIONS: There is no established gold standard for the diagnosis of LTBI. Results of any modeling task are limited by the accuracy of available data. CONCLUSIONS: Prior to starting steroid therapy, only patients in areas with a high prevalence of LTBI will benefit from universal TST. As more evidence becomes available about the use of IGRA testing in children, the assay may become a component of cost-effective screening protocols in populations with a higher burden of LTBI.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: High costs are a limitation to scaling up the Xpert MTB/RIF assay (Xpert) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in resource-constrained settings. A triaging strategy in which a sensitive but not necessarily highly specific rapid test is used to select patients for Xpert may result in a more affordable diagnostic algorithm. To inform the selection and development of particular diagnostics as a triage test we explored combinations of sensitivity, specificity and cost at which a hypothetical triage test will improve affordability of the Xpert assay. METHODS: In a decision analytical model parameterized for Uganda, India and South Africa, we compared a diagnostic algorithm in which a cohort of patients with presumptive TB received Xpert to a triage algorithm whereby only those with a positive triage test were tested by Xpert. FINDINGS: A triage test with sensitivity equal to Xpert, 75{\%} specificity, and costs of US{\$}5 per patient tested reduced total diagnostic costs by 42{\%} in the Uganda setting, and by 34{\%} and 39{\%} respectively in the India and South Africa settings. When exploring triage algorithms with lower sensitivity, the use of an example triage test with 95{\%} sensitivity relative to Xpert, 75{\%} specificity and test costs {\$}5 resulted in similar cost reduction, and was cost-effective by the WHO willingness-to-pay threshold compared to Xpert for all in Uganda, but not in India and South Africa. The gain in affordability of the examined triage algorithms increased with decreasing prevalence of tuberculosis among the cohort. CONCLUSIONS: A triage test strategy could potentially improve the affordability of Xpert for TB diagnosis, particularly in low-income countries and with enhanced case-finding. Tests and markers with lower accuracy than desired of a diagnostic test may fall within the ranges of sensitivity, specificity and cost required for triage tests and be developed as such.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: TB in India presents the challenges of a complex disease in a complex healthcare system. Mathematical models, offering a framework for capturing such complexities, have proven useful in exploring strategies for the control of TB. As the use of such techniques develops in future, it is important to understand what aspects of the healthcare system are most critical for models to faithfully capture. METHODS: We ask what type of intervention should be prioritized for the control of TB, amongst: improved diagnosis of TB per visit to a healthcare provider; improved treatment success; and increased identification of TB cases in the community? Using simple mathematical models, calibrated to the national TB epidemic in India, we explore how the relative importance of each of these interventions is affected by different assumptions for the patient pathway in careseeking, thus outlining aspects of the healthcare system that may matter most for the transmission dynamics of TB. RESULTS: We illustrate that, under a range of plausible parameter assumptions, it is possible to generate conditions under which a case-finding intervention would be prioritized over improvement of diagnosis and treatment, and vice versa. Key data needs include: the proportion of patients not contacting the healthcare system, and the mean patient delay before first seeking care. CONCLUSIONS: For mathematical models addressing strategic priorities for TB control, it is important to adequately quantify the dynamics of careseeking. We outline ways in which these data gaps may be addressed, and questions for future work.},

The ability of the bacteria to persist in the form of a long-term asymptomatic infection, referred to as latent tuberculosis, is central to the biology of the disease. The persistence of bacteria in superficially normal tissue was recognized soon after the discovery of the tubercle bacillus, and much of our knowledge about persistent populations of M. tuberculosis dates back to the first half of the last century. Recent advances in microbial genetics and host immunity provide an opportunity for renewed investigation of this persistent threat to human health.},

abstract = {Effective tuberculosis (TB) control depends on case findings to discover infectious cases, investigation of contacts of those with TB, as well as appropriate treatment. Adherence and successful completion of the treatment are equally important. Unfortunately, due to a number of personal, psychosocial, economic, medical, and health service factors, a significant number of TB patients become irregular and default from treatment. In this paper, a mathematical model is developed to assess the impact of early therapy for latent TB and non-adherence on controlling TB transmission dynamics. Equilibrium states of the model are determined and their local stability is examined. With the aid of the center manifold theory, it is established that the model undergoes a backward bifurcation. Qualitative mathematical analysis of the model suggests that a high level of latent tuberculosis case findings, coupled with a decrease of defaulting rate, may be effective in controlling TB transmission dynamics in the community. Population-level effects of organized campaigns to improve early therapy and to guarantee successful completion of each treatment are evaluated through numerical simulations and presented in support of the analytical results.},

abstract = {This article describes the population pharmacokinetics of rifampin in South African pulmonary tuberculosis patients. Three datasets containing 2,913 rifampin plasma concentration-time data points, collected from 261 South African pulmonary tuberculosis patients aged 18 to 72 years and weighing 28.5 to 85.5 kg and receiving regular daily treatment that included administration of rifampin (450 to 600 mg) for at least 10 days, were pooled. A compartmental pharmacokinetic model was developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling. Variability in the shape of the absorption curve was described using a flexible transit compartment model, in which a delay in the onset of absorption and a gradually changing absorption rate were modeled as the passage of drug through a chain of hypothetical compartments, ultimately reaching the absorption compartment. A previously described implementation was extended to allow its application to multiple-dosing data. The typical population estimate of oral clearance was 19.2 liters x h(-1), while the volume of distribution was estimated to be 53.2 liters. Interindividual variability was estimated to be 52.8{\%} for clearance and 43.4{\%} for volume of distribution. Interoccasional variability was estimated for CL/F (22.5{\%}) and mean transit time during absorption (67.9{\%}). The use of single-drug formulations was found to increase both the mean transit time (by 104{\%}) and clearance (by 23.6{\%}) relative to fixed-dose-combination use. A strong correlation between clearance and volume of distribution suggested substantial variability in bioavailability, which could have clinical implications, given the dependence of treatment effectiveness on exposure. The final model successfully described rifampin pharmacokinetics in the population studied and is suitable for simulation in this context.},

abstract = {AIMS: To compare genetic composition of plasmids using microarrays composed of randomly selected fragments of plasmid DNA. METHODS AND RESULTS: Separate shotgun libraries were constructed from plasmid DNA pooled from Escherichia coli and Salmonella enterica. Cloned fragments were used as probes for microarrays. Plasmid targets were labelled, hybridized overnight, and bound targets were imaged after enzymatic signal amplification. Control hybridizations demonstrated significantly higher signal when probes and targets shared {\textgreater}95{\%} sequence identity. Diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of the assay was 95 and 99{\%}, respectively. Cluster analysis showed close matches for replicate experiments with a high correlation between replicates (r = 0.91) compared with the correlation for nonreplicates (r = 0.09). Analysis of hybridization data from 43 plasmids generated five distinct clusters, two for known serovar-specific plasmids, one for enterohemorrhagic E. coli plasmids, and two for plasmids harboring a recently disseminated antibiotic resistance gene (bla(CMY-2)). CONCLUSION: Mixed-plasmid microarrays are suitable for comparing genetic content of wild-type plasmids and hybridization results from this study suggest several novel hypotheses about plasmid gene exchange between E. coli and S. enterica. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF STUDY: Mixed-plasmid microarrays permit rapid, low cost analysis and comparison of many plasmids. This ability is critical to understanding the source, fate, and transport of plasmids amongst commensal and pathogenic bacteria.},

Globally, 6.7 million new cases of tuberculosis and 2.4 million deaths from tuberculosis are estimated for 1998.

Active case-finding by using mass miniature radiography could save 23 million lives over this period. A single contact treatment for tuberculosis could avert 24 million cases and 11 million deaths; combined with active screening, it could reduce mortality by nearly 40{\%}. A new vaccine with 50{\%} efficacy could lower incidence by 36 million cases and mortality by 9 million deaths.

Its effect in populations with a high proportion of dually infected individuals is likely to be significant. Sub-Saharan Africa is one such region and to better document the effect of HIV infection on tuberculosis there we developed a mathematical model to predict the likely extra numbers of tuberculosis cases due to it. A mathematical model was developed using a variety of scenarios giving a range of risks for the period 1980-2000. The four scenarios included (1) a low rate of 1{\%} risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 (1980) with 45{\%} tuberculosis infection prevalence, and an HIV prevalence of 2{\%} in 1989; (2) a 2{\%} risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60{\%} tuberculosis infection prevalence, and a 2{\%} HIV prevalence in 1989; (3) a 2{\%} risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60{\%} tuberculosis infection prevalence, and a 10{\%} HIV prevalence in 1989; and (4) a 2{\%} risk of tuberculosis infection in year 0 with 60{\%} tuberculosis infection prevalence and a 20{\%} HIV prevalence in 1989. Under scenarios 1 and 2, a 50-60{\%} increase in smear-positive rates in the subpopulation (15-45 years old) is predicted for the year 2000, under scenario 3, smear-positive rates in the subpopulation in the year 2000 are expected to increase four-fold from the 1980 baseline. Under scenario 4, a 10-fold increase in smear-positive rates in 2000 is expected in the subpopulation. Under this scenario, total disease will have increased 12-fold in the subpopulation.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

An adapted quality assessment tool was developed, with a resulting median study quality score of 20/28. The literature remains divided as to whether vaccines effective pre- or post-infection would provide greatest epidemiological impact. However, all-age or adolescent/adult targeted prevention of disease vaccines achieve greater and more rapid impact than neonatal vaccines.

Economic evaluations found TB vaccines overwhelmingly cost-effective, particularly when targeted to adolescents/adults.

abstract = {SUMMARY: Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of death worldwide despite the availability of effective chemotherapy for over 60 years. Although Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccination protects against active TB disease in some populations, its efficacy is suboptimal. Development of an effective TB vaccine is a top global priority that has been hampered by an incomplete understanding of protective immunity to TB. Thus far, preventing TB disease, rather than infection, has been the primary target for vaccine development. Several areas of research highlight the importance of including preinfection vaccines in the development pipeline. First, epidemiology and mathematical modeling studies indicate that a preinfection vaccine would have a high population-level impact for control of TB disease. Second, immunology studies support the rationale for targeting prevention of infection, with evidence that host responses may be more effective during acute infection than during chronic infection. Third, natural history studies indicate that resistance to TB infection occurs in a small percentage of the population. Fourth, case-control studies of BCG indicate that it may provide protection from infection. Fifth, prevention-of-infection trials would have smaller sample sizes and a shorter duration than disease prevention trials and would enable opportunities to search for correlates of immunity as well as serve as a criterion for selecting a vaccine product for testing in a larger TB disease prevention trial. Together, these points support expanding the focus of TB vaccine development efforts to include prevention of infection as a primary goal along with vaccines or other interventions that reduce the rate of transmission and reactivation.},

abstract = {SETTING: National tuberculin skin test surveys. OBJECTIVES: To review the operating characteristics of the tuberculin skin test, to ascertain the validity of estimating prevalence and risk of infection from tuberculin skin test surveys under various conditions, and to review constraints in the estimation of the magnitude of the tuberculosis problem in the community from such surveys. METHODS: This report utilizes hypothetical and selected real data obtained in regional and national surveys at various points in time to exemplify methodological issues. RESULTS: Risk of infection, the essence to be abstracted from tuberculin skin test surveys, theoretically allows for a comparison of the extent of transmission of tubercle bacilli in various populations. However, the conduct of tuberculin skin test surveys and the analysis and interpretation of their results are not free from important technical problems. Accurate estimation of infection prevalence is particularly vulnerable to the great variability of the test's specificity under various circumstances. Furthermore, the annual risk of infection has averaging characteristics that preclude a rapid assessment of changes in transmission patterns. Finally, estimates of infection risk do not necessarily provide a standardized parameter to derive incidence of infectious cases, because of variations in the quality of intervention and varying risks of progression from latent infection to overt tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: While tuberculin skin test surveys provide the currently most widely used means of assessing tuberculosis transmission patterns over prolonged periods of time in a community, results from such surveys must be interpreted with caution when accurate estimates of the tuberculosis problem are sought.},

abstract = {Background: Continuing rises in tuberculosis notifications in the UK are attributable to cases in foreign-born immigrants. National guidance for immigrant screening is hampered by a lack of data about the prevalence of, and risk factors for, latent tuberculosis infection in immigrants. We aimed to determine the prevalence of latent infection in immigrants to the UK to define which groups should be screened and to quantify cost-effectiveness. Methods: In our multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis we analysed demographic and test results from three centres in the UK (from 2008 to 2010) that used interferon-?? release-assay (IGRA) to screen immigrants aged 35 years or younger for latent tuberculosis infection. We assessed factors associated with latent infection by use of logistic regression and calculated the yields and cost-effectiveness of screening at different levels of tuberculosis incidence in immigrants' countries of origin with a decision analysis model. Findings: Results for IGRA-based screening were positive in 245 of 1229 immigrants (20{\%}), negative in 982 (80{\%}), and indeterminate in two (0??2{\%}). Positive results were independently associated with increases in tuberculosis incidence in immigrants' countries of origin (p=0??0006), male sex (p=0??046), and age (p{\textless}0??0001). National policy thus far would fail to detect 71{\%} of individuals with latent infection. The two most cost-effective strategies were to screen individuals from countries with a tuberculosis incidence of more than 250 cases per 100 000 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] was ??17 956 [??1=US{\$}1??60] per prevented case of tuberculosis) and at more than 150 cases per 100 000 (including immigrants from the Indian subcontinent), which identified 92{\%} of infected immigrants and prevented an additional 29 cases at an ICER of ??20 819 per additional case averted. Interpretation: Screening for latent infection can be implemented cost-effectively at a level of incidence that identifies most immigrants with latent tuberculosis, thereby preventing substantial numbers of future cases of active tuberculosis.

abstract = {Alveolar macrophages play a large role in the innate immune response of the lung. However, when these highly immune-regulatory cells are unable to eradicate pathogens, the adaptive immune system, which includes activated macrophages and lymphocytes, particularly T cells, is called upon to control the pathogens. This collection of immune cells surrounds, isolates and quarantines the pathogen, forming a small tissue structure called a granuloma for intracellular pathogens like Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). In the present work we develop a mathematical model of the dynamics of a granuloma by a system of partial differential equations. The 'strength' of the adaptive immune response to infection in the lung is represented by a parameter alpha, the flux rate by which T cells and M1 macrophages that immigrated from the lymph nodes enter into the granuloma through its boundary. The parameter alpha is negatively correlated with the 'switching time', namely, the time it takes for the number of M1 type macrophages to surpass the number of infected, M2 type alveolar macrophages. Simulations of the model show that as alpha increases the radius of the granuloma and bacterial load in the granuloma both decrease. The model is used to determine the efficacy of potential host-directed therapies in terms of the parameter alpha, suggesting that, with fixed dosing level, an infected individual with a stronger immune response will receive greater benefits in terms of reducing the bacterial load.},

abstract = {Since 1927 and until recently, most models describing the spread of disease have been of compartmental type, based on the assumption that populations are homogeneous and well-mixed. Recent models have utilised agent-based models and complex networks to explicitly study heterogeneous interaction patterns, but this leads to an increasing computational complexity. Compartmental models are appealing because of their simplicity, but their parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a number of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single environmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the population. Therefore, in this contribution we propose a middle ground, utilising crowd-behaviour research to improve compartmental models in crowded situations. We show how both the rate of infection as well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an infected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a population scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd density. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and compare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the regime in which current models may not produce credible results.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes increases the risk of tuberculosis incidence and the risk of adverse treatment outcomes in patients with tuberculosis. Because prevalence of diabetes is increasing in low-income and middle-income countries where the burden of tuberculosis is high, prevention of diabetes carries the potential to improve tuberculosis control worldwide. METHODS: We used dynamic tuberculosis transmission models to analyse the potential effect of diabetes on tuberculosis epidemiology in 13 countries with high tuberculosis burden. We used data for previous diabetes prevalence in each country and constructed scenarios to represent the potential ranges of future diabetes prevalence. The country-specific model was calibrated to the estimated trend of tuberculosis incidence. We estimated the tuberculosis burden that can be reduced by alternative scenarios of diabetes prevention. FINDINGS: If the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise as it has been in the past decade in the 13 countries (base case scenario), by 2035, the cumulative reduction in tuberculosis incidence would be 8.8{\%} (95{\%} credible interval [CrI] 4.0-15.8) and mortality would be 34.0{\%} (30.3-39.6). Lowering the prevalence of diabetes by an absolute level of 6.6-13.8{\%} could accelerate the decline of tuberculosis incidence by an absolute level of 11.5-25.2{\%} and tuberculosis mortality by 8.7-19.4{\%}. Compared with the base case scenario, stopping the rise of diabetes would avoid 6.0 million (95{\%} CrI 5.1-6.9) incident cases and 1.1 million (1.0-1.3) tuberculosis deaths in 13 countries during 20 years. If interventions reduce diabetes incidence by 35{\%} by 2025, 7.8 million (6.7-9.0) tuberculosis cases and 1.5 million (1.3-1.7) tuberculosis deaths could be averted by 2035. INTERPRETATION: The diabetes epidemic could substantially affect tuberculosis epidemiology in high burden countries. The communicable disease and non-communicable disease sectors need to move beyond conventional boundaries and link with each other to form a joint response to diabetes and tuberculosis.

In this study, we use a computational model, calibrated against notification data from Arkansas during the period 2001-2011, that reproduces independent data on key features of TB transmission and epidemiology. The model estimates that the Arkansas contact investigations program has avoided 18.6{\%} (12.1-25.9{\%}) of TB cases and 23.7{\%} (16.4-30.6{\%}) of TB deaths that would have occurred during 2001-2014 if passive diagnosis alone were implemented. If contacts of sputum smear-negative cases had not been included in the program, the percentage reduction would have been remarkably lower. In addition, we predict that achieving national targets for performance indicators of contact investigation programs has strong potential to further reduce TB transmission and burden. However, contact investigations are expected to have limited effectiveness on avoiding reactivation cases of latent infections over the next 60 years.},

abstract = {The choice of summary statistics is a crucial step in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Since statistics are often not sufficient, this choice involves a trade-off between loss of information and reduction of dimensionality. The latter may increase the efficiency of ABC. Here, we propose an approach for choosing summary statistics based on boosting, a technique from the machine-learning literature. We consider different types of boosting and compare them to partial least-squares regression as an alternative. To mitigate the lack of sufficiency, we also propose an approach for choosing summary statistics locally, in the putative neighborhood of the true parameter value. We study a demographic model motivated by the reintroduction of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) into the Swiss Alps. The parameters of interest are the mean and standard deviation across microsatellites of the scaled ancestral mutation rate ($\theta$(anc) = 4N(e)u) and the proportion of males obtaining access to matings per breeding season ($\omega$). By simulation, we assess the properties of the posterior distribution obtained with the various methods. According to our criteria, ABC with summary statistics chosen locally via boosting with the L(2)-loss performs best. Applying that method to the ibex data, we estimate $\theta$(anc)≈ 1.288 and find that most of the variation across loci of the ancestral mutation rate u is between 7.7 × 10(-4) and 3.5 × 10(-3) per locus per generation. The proportion of males with access to matings is estimated as $\omega$≈ 0.21, which is in good agreement with recent independent estimates.},

abstract = {Several infectious diseases of global importance-e.g., HIV infection and tuberculosis (TB)-require prolonged treatment with combination antimicrobial regimens typically involving high-potency core agents coupled with additional companion drugs that protect against the de novo emergence of mutations conferring resistance to the core agents. Often, the most effective (or least toxic) companion agents are reused in sequential (first-line, second-line, etc.) regimens. We used a multistrain model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission in Southeast Asia to investigate how this practice might facilitate the emergence of extensive drug resistance, i.e., resistance to multiple core agents. We calibrated this model to regional TB and drug resistance data using an approximate Bayesian computational approach. We report the proportion of data-consistent simulations in which the prevalence of pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB-defined as resistance to both first-line and second-line core agents (rifampin and fluoroquinolones)-exceeds predefined acceptability thresholds (1 to 2 cases per 100,000 population by 2035). The use of pyrazinamide (the most effective companion agent) in both first-line and second-line regimens increased the proportion of simulations in which the prevalence exceeded the pre-XDR acceptability threshold by 7-fold compared to a scenario in which patients with pyrazinamide-resistant TB received an alternative drug. Model parameters related to the emergence and transmission of pyrazinamide-resistant TB and resistance amplification were among those that were the most strongly correlated with the projected pre-XDR prevalence, indicating that pyrazinamide resistance acquired during first-line treatment subsequently promotes amplification to pre-XDR TB under pyrazinamide-containing second-line treatment. These findings suggest that the appropriate use of companion drugs may be critical to preventing the emergence of strains resistant to multiple core agents.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Complex biological systems exhibit a property of robustness at all levels of organization. Through different mechanisms, the system tries to sustain stress such as due to starvation or drug exposure. To explore whether reconfiguration of the metabolic networks is used as a means to achieve robustness, we have studied possible metabolic adjustments in Mtb upon exposure to isoniazid (INH), a front-line clinical drug. The redundancy in the genome of M. tuberculosis (Mtb) makes it an attractive system to explore if alternate routes of metabolism exist in the bacterium. While the mechanism of action of INH is well studied, its effect on the overall metabolism is not well characterized. Using flux balance analysis, inhibiting the fluxes flowing through the reactions catalyzed by Rv1484, the target of INH, significantly changes the overall flux profiles. At the pathway level, activation or inactivation of certain pathways distant from the target pathway, are seen. Metabolites such as NADPH are shown to reduce drastically, while fatty acids tend to accumulate. The overall biomass also decreases with increasing inhibition levels. Inhibition studies, pathway level clustering and comparison of the flux profiles with the gene expression data indicate the activation of folate metabolism, ubiquinone metabolism, and metabolism of certain amino acids. This analysis provides insights useful for target identification and designing strategies for combination therapy. Insights gained about the role of individual components of a system and their interactions will also provide a basis for reconstruction of whole systems through synthetic biology approaches.

abstract = {BACKGROUND We examined the potential sex-differential and non-specific effects of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles vaccine (MV) in a rural area of Senegal. METHODS The 4133 children born in the area between 1996 and 1999 were included in the study. Vaccinations were provided at three health centres. Vaccine information was collected through 3-monthly home visits. The survival analysis compared the effects of BCG and DTP according to the following sequence of vaccinations: BCG-first, BCG+DTP1-first, or DTP1-first. We compared DTP and MV between 9 and 24 months of age, as 9 months is the minimum age for MV. RESULTS At 12 months the vaccination coverage was 44{\%}, 46{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively, for BCG, DTP1 and MV. Most children received BCG+DTP1-first and this combination was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate ratio (MRR) of 0.69 (0.53-0.89) compared with unvaccinated children. There was no benefit for children receiving BCG-first or DTP1-first. The female-male MRR was 0.79 (0.64-0.96) among unvaccinated children, but was significantly inversed with 1.45 (1.00-2.10) for children receiving DTP vaccination (test of homogeneity, p=0.006). Children who had received DTP simultaneously with MV or DTP after MV had significantly higher mortality (MRR=2.59 [1.32-5.07]) compared with children having MV-only as their most recent vaccination. After 9 months, the female-male MRR was 0.61 (0.31-1.19) for measles-vaccinated children but remained 1.54 (1.03-2.31) for DTP-vaccinated children who had not received MV (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS The sequence of routine vaccinations is important for the overall impact on child survival and these vaccines are associated with sex-differential effects.},

abstract = {Current theory in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis holds that tuberculosis cases harboring Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains with a common deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) fingerprint are the result of recent M. tuberculosis transmission. Here we propose a mathematical approach independent of DNA fingerprinting to estimating the percentage of recent transmissions responsible for current tuberculosis incidence. The "short-term reproductive number" of tuberculosis is defined as the average number of tuberculosis cases developing within 1 year of infection. Multiplying the short-term reproductive number by the number of tuberculosis cases in each year and dividing by the subsequent year's tuberculosis case burden equals the proportion of tuberculosis cases in the subsequent year that are due to recent transmission. We carried out separate calculations for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative and HIV-positive tuberculosis cases. We applied the model to pulmonary (infectious) tuberculosis cases diagnosed in New York City during 1989-1993, using tuberculosis and AIDS surveillance data. Model-based estimates of the proportion of tuberculosis due to recent transmission were lower than estimates based on DNA fingerprints. Reconciliation of these divergent estimates may require the re-estimation of model parameters from data collected de novo, additional model development, and further advances in DNA fingerprinting methods.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relative efficacy of personal respiratory protection as the concentrations of infectious aerosols increase or as room ventilation rates decrease. METHODS: We modified the Wells-Riley mathematical model of airborne transmission of disease by adding a variable for respirator leakage. We modeled three categories of infectiousness using various room ventilation rates and classes of respirators over a 10-hour exposure period. RESULTS: The risk of infection decreases exponentially with increasing room ventilation or with increasing personal respiratory protection. The relative efficacy of personal respiratory protection decreases as room ventilation rates increase or as the concentrations of infectious aerosols decrease. CONCLUSIONS: These modeling data suggest that the risk of occupational tuberculosis probably can be lowered considerably by using relatively simple respirators combined with modest room ventilation rates for the infectious aerosols likely to be present in isolation rooms of newly diagnosed patients. However, more sophisticated respirators may be needed to achieve a comparable risk reduction for exposures to more highly concentrated aerosols, such as may be generated during cough-inducing procedures or autopsies involving infectious patients. There is probably minimal benefit to the use of respirators in well-ventilated isolation rooms with patients receiving appropriate therapy.},

abstract = {For some diseases, the transmission of infection can cause spatial clustering of disease cases. This clustering has an impact on how one estimates the rate of the spread of the disease and on the design of control strategies. It is, however, difficult to assess such clustering, (local effects on transmission), using traditional statistical methods. A stochastic Markov-chain model that takes into account possible local or more dispersed global effects on the risk of contracting disease is introduced in the context of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. The model is used to analyse TB notifications collected in the Asembo and Gem Divisions of Nyanza Province in western Kenya by the Kenya Ministry of Health/National Leprosy and Tuberculosis Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The model shows evidence of a pronounced local effect that is significantly greater than the global effect. We discuss a number of variations of the model which identify how this local effect depends on factors such as age and gender. Zoning/clustering of villages is used to identify the influence that zone size has on the model's ability to distinguish local and global effects. An important possible use of the model is in the design of a community randomised trial where geographical clusters of people are divided into two groups and the effectiveness of an intervention policy is assessed by applying it to one group but not the other. Here the model can be used to take the effect of case clustering into consideration in calculating the minimum difference in an outcome variable (e.g. disease prevalence) that can be detected with statistical significance. It thereby gauges the potential effectiveness of such a trial. Such a possible application is illustrated with the given time/spatial TB data set.},

abstract = {Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Gu??rin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis. In this work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis. The results of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Blaser2016a,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in South Africa. The burden of disease varies by age, with peaks in TB notification rates in the HIV-negative population at ages 0-5, 20-24, and 45-49 years. There is little variation between age groups in the rates in the HIV-positive population. The drivers of this age pattern remain unknown. METHODS: We developed an age-structured simulation model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in Cape Town, South Africa. We considered five states of TB progression: susceptible, infected (latent TB), active TB, treated TB, and treatment default. Latently infected individuals could be re-infected; a previous Mtb infection slowed progression to active disease. We further considered three states of HIV progression: HIV negative, HIV positive, on antiretroviral therapy. To parameterize the model, we analysed treatment outcomes from the Cape Town electronic TB register, social mixing patterns from a Cape Town community and used literature estimates for other parameters. To investigate the main drivers behind the age patterns, we conducted sensitivity analyses on all parameters related to the age structure. RESULTS: The model replicated the age patterns in HIV-negative TB notification rates of Cape Town in 2009. Simulated TB notification rate in HIV-negative patients was 1000/100,000 person-years (pyrs) in children aged {\textless}5 years and decreased to 51/100,000 in children 5-15 years. The peak in early adulthood occurred at 25-29 years (463/100,000 pyrs). After a subsequent decline, simulated TB notification rates gradually increased from the age of 30 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the dip after the early adult peak was due to the protective effect of latent TB and that retreatment TB was mainly responsible for the rise in TB notification rates from the age of 30 years. CONCLUSION: The protective effect of a first latent infection on subsequent infections and the faster progression in previously treated patients are the key determinants of the age-structure of TB notification rates in Cape Town.},

abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, both in deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during this type of analyses.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a global health issue with annually about 1.5 million deaths and 2 billion infected people worldwide. Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis comprises 13{\%} of all cases of which tuberculous meningitis is the most severe. It has a high mortality and is often diagnosed once irreversible neurological damage has already occurred. Development of diagnostic and treatment strategies requires a thorough understanding of the pathogenesis of tuberculous meningitis. This disease is characterized by the formation of a cerebral granuloma, which is a collection of immune cells that attempt to immunologically restrain, and physically contain bacteria. The cytokine tumor necrosis factor-alpha is known for its important role in granuloma formation. Because traditional experimental animal studies exploring tuberculous meningitis are difficult and expensive, another approach is needed to begin to address this important and significant disease outcome. Here, we present an in silico model capturing the unique immunological environment of the brain that allows us to study the key mechanisms driving granuloma formation in time. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis reveals a dose-dependent effect of tumor necrosis factor-alpha on bacterial load and immune cell numbers thereby influencing the onset of tuberculous meningitis. Insufficient levels result in bacterial overgrowth, whereas high levels lead to uncontrolled inflammation being detrimental to the host. These findings have important implications for the development of immuno-modulating treatment strategies for tuberculous meningitis.},

abstract = {Bacteriophages are a major cause of bacterial mortality and impose strong selection on natural bacterial populations, yet their effects on the dynamics of conjugative plasmids have rarely been tested. We combined experimental evolution, mathe-matical modeling, and individual-based simulations to explain how the ecological and population genetics effects of bacterio-phages upon bacteria interact to determine the dynamics of conjugative plasmids and their persistence. The ecological effects of bacteriophages on bacteria are predicted to limit the existence conditions for conjugative plasmids, preventing persistence under weak selection for plasmid accessory traits. Experiments showed that phages drove faster extinction of plasmids in environments where the plasmid conferred no benefit, but they also revealed more complex effects of phages on plasmid dynamics under these conditions, specifically, the temporary maintenance of plasmids at fixation followed by rapid loss. We hypothesized that the population genetic effects of bacteriophages, specifically, selection for phage resistance mutations, may have caused this. Further mathematical modeling and individual-based simulations supported our hypothesis, showing that conjugative plasmids may hitchhike with phage resistance mutations in the bacterial chromosome. IMPORTANCE Conjugative plasmids are infectious loops of DNA capable of transmitting DNA between bacterial cells and be-tween species. Because plasmids often carry extra genes that allow bacteria to live in otherwise-inhospitable environments, their dynamics are central to understanding bacterial adaptive evolution. The plasmid-bacterium interaction has typically been stud-ied in isolation, but in natural bacterial communities, bacteriophages, viruses that infect bacteria, are ubiquitous. Using experi-ments, mathematical models, and computer simulations we show that bacteriophages drive plasmid dynamics through their ecological and evolutionary effects on bacteria and ultimately limit the conditions allowing plasmid existence. These results ad-vance our understanding of bacterial adaptation and show that bacteriophages could be used to select against plasmids carrying undesirable traits, such as antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {Prediction of metabolic changes that result from genetic or environmental perturbations has several important applications, including diagnosing metabolic disorders and discovering novel drug targets. A cardinal challenge in obtaining accurate predictions is the integration of transcriptional regulatory networks with the corresponding metabolic network. We propose a method called probabilistic regulation of metabolism (PROM) that achieves this synthesis and enables straightforward, automated, and quantitative integration of high-throughput data into constraint-based modeling, making it an ideal tool for constructing genome-scale regulatory-metabolic network models for less-studied organisms. PROM introduces probabilities to represent gene states and gene-transcription factor interactions. By using PROM, we constructed an integrated regulatory-metabolic network for the model organism, Escherichia coli, and demonstrated that our method based on automated inference is more accurate and comprehensive than the current state of the art, which is based on manual curation of literature. After validating the approach, we used PROM to build a genome-scale integrated metabolic-regulatory model for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, a critically important human pathogen. This study incorporated data from more than 1,300 microarrays, 2,000 transcription factor-target interactions regulating 3,300 metabolic reactions, and 1,905 KO phenotypes for E. coli and M. tuberculosis. PROM identified KO phenotypes with accuracies as high as 95{\%}, and predicted growth rates quantitatively with correlation of 0.95. Importantly, PROM represents the successful integration of a top-down reconstructed, statistically inferred regulatory network with a bottom-up reconstructed, biochemically detailed metabolic network, bridging two important classes of systems biology models that are rarely combined quantitatively.},

abstract = {Antibiotics have always been considered one of the wonder discoveries of the 20th century. This is true, but the real wonder is the rise of antibiotic resistance in hospitals, communities, and the environment concomitant with their use. The extraordinary genetic capacities of microbes have benefitted from man's overuse of antibiotics to exploit every source of resistance genes and every means of horizontal gene transmission to develop multiple mechanisms of resistance for each and every antibiotic introduced into practice clinically, agriculturally, or otherwise. This review presents the salient aspects of antibiotic resistance development over the past half-century, with the oft-restated conclusion that it is time to act. To achieve complete restitution of therapeutic applications of antibiotics, there is a need for more information on the role of environmental microbiomes in the rise of antibiotic resistance. In particular, creative approaches to the discovery of novel antibiotics and their expedited and controlled introduction to therapy are obligatory.},

abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

A seasonality TB epidemic model with periodic varying contact rate, reactivation rate, and disease-induced death rate is proposed to explore the impact of seasonality on the transmission dynamics of TB. Simulations show that the basic reproduction number of time-averaged autonomous systems may underestimate or overestimate infection risks in some cases, which may be up to the value of period. The basic reproduction number of the seasonality model is appropriately given, which determines the extinction and uniform persistence of TB disease. If it is less than one, then the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable; if it is greater than one, the system at least has a positive periodic solution and the disease will persist. Moreover, numerical simulations demonstrate these theorem results.},

METHODS: The Birth Register data were used to generate a list of babies born in the catchment area of Basildon and Thurrock NHS Trust between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2001 who were eligible for BCG immunization. The Community Child Health computer was used to generate information about their BCG immunization status. RESULTS: 201 children were included in the study. One hundred and seventy-one children had received BCG immunization in the neonatal period, out of which 169 had received it before discharge from the hospital. Two children were immunized in the community in the neonatal period. Thus, 85{\%} of the newborns eligible for BCG immunization received their vaccination in the neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: The current "Neonatal BCG Immunisation Policy" is effective, and there is a high uptake of the vaccine in the neonatal period within the hospital itself. Newborn infants who do not receive BCG immunization in hospital rarely get immunized in the community.},

We find that only 6 of the 50 parameters analysed are important to the cumulative number of clinically active TB patients in the entire region. Of these, only the detection rate in PNG is found to be an important intervention parameter. We therefore give insight into the extent the area with the high burden of TB (PNG in the case study) is dominating the TB dynamics of the entire region.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New drugs for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are becoming available for the first time in over 40 y. Optimal strategies for introducing these drugs have not yet been established. The objective of this study was to compare different strategies for introducing the new TB drug bedaquiline based on patients' resistance patterns. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We created a Markov decision model to follow a hypothetical cohort of multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB patients under different bedaquiline use strategies. The explored strategies included making bedaquiline available to all patients with MDR TB, restricting bedaquiline usage to patients with MDR plus additional resistance and withholding bedaquiline introduction completely. We compared these strategies according to life expectancy, risks of acquired resistance, and the expected number and health outcomes of secondary cases. For our simulated cohort, the mean (2.5th, 97.5th percentile) life expectancy from time of initiation of MDR TB treatment at age 30 was 36.0 y (33.5, 38.7) assuming all patients with MDR TB received bedaquiline, 35.1 y (34.4, 35.8) assuming patients with pre-extensively drug-resistant (PreXDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) TB received bedaquiline, and 34.9 y (34.6, 35.2) assuming only patients with XDR TB received bedaquiline. Although providing bedaquiline to all MDR patients resulted in the highest life expectancy for our initial cohort averaged across all parameter sets, for parameter sets in which bedaquiline conferred high risks of added mortality and only small reductions in median time to culture conversion, the optimal strategy would be to withhold use even from patients with the most extensive resistance. Across all parameter sets, the most liberal bedaquiline use strategies consistently increased the risk of bedaquiline resistance but decreased the risk of resistance to other MDR drugs. In almost all cases, more liberal bedaquiline use strategies reduced the expected number of secondary cases and resulting life years lost. The generalizability of our results is limited by the lack of available data about drug effects among individuals with HIV co-infection, drug interactions, and other sources of heterogeneity, as well as changing recommendations for MDR TB treatment. CONCLUSIONS: If mortality benefits can be empirically verified, our results provide support for expanding bedaquiline access to all patients with MDR TB. Such expansion could improve patients' health, protect background MDR TB drugs, and decrease transmission, but would likely result in greater resistance to bedaquiline.},

The purpose of the survey was to determine factors that could enhance the case detection rate of tuberculosis. Results from the survey identified four key factors that must be combined for an effective control of TB and increase the case detection rate: effective awareness programme, active cough identification, associated cost factor for treatment of identified cases and effective treatment. The overall effect of these factors on the basic reproduction number under treatment, R(T), of the TB model was considered. In all, a serious concentration on tuberculosis awareness programmes and active cough identification as a marker for someone having TB was shown to significantly reduce the value of the reproduction number, hereby reducing the severity of the disease in the presence of treatment.},

abstract = {The comparative-genomic sequencing of two Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains enabled us to identify single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for studies of evolution, pathogenesis, and epidemiology in clinical M. tuberculosis. Phylogenetic analysis using these "comparative-genome markers" (CGMs) produced a highly unusual phylogeny with a complete absence of secondary branches. To investigate CGM-based phylogenies, we devised computer models to simulate sequence evolution and calculate new phylogenies based on an SNP format. We found that CGMs represent a distinct class of phylogenetic markers that depend critically on the genetic distances between compared "reference strains." Properly distanced reference strains generate CGMs that accurately depict evolutionary relationships, distorted only by branch collapse. Improperly distanced reference strains generate CGMs that distort and reroot outgroups. Applying this understanding to the CGM-based phylogeny of M. tuberculosis, we found evidence to suggest that this species is highly clonal without detectable lateral gene exchange. We noted indications of evolutionary bottlenecks, including one at the level of the PHRI "C" strain previously associated with particular virulence characteristics. Our evidence also suggests that loss of IS6110 to fewer than seven elements per genome is uncommon. Finally, we present population-based evidence that KasA, an important component of mycolic acid biosynthesis, develops G312S polymorphisms under selective pressure.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease caused by Mycobacteria tuberculosis. Tuberculosis as a chronic and highly infectious disease is prevalent in almost every part of the globe. More than 95{\%} of TB mortality occurs in low/middle income countries. In 2014, approximately 10 million people were diagnosed with active TB and two million died from the disease. In this study, our aim is to compare the predictive powers of the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) and neural network auto-regression (SARIMA-NNAR) models of TB incidence and analyse its seasonality in South Africa. Methods: TB incidence cases data from January 2010 to December 2015 were extracted from the Eastern Cape Health facility report of the electronic Tuberculosis Register (ERT. Net). A SARIMA model and a combined model of SARIMA model and a neural network auto-regression (SARIMA-NNAR) model were used in analysing and predicting the TB data from 2010 to 2015. Simulation performance parameters of mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), mean percent error (MPE), mean absolute scaled error (MASE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were applied to assess the better performance of prediction between the models. Results: Though practically, both models could predict TB incidence, the combined model displayed better performance. For the combined model, the Akaike information criterion (AIC), second-order AIC (AICc) and Bayesian information criterion (BIC) are 288.56, 308.31 and 299.09 respectively, which were lower than the SARIMA model with corresponding values of 329.02, 327.20 and 341.99, respectively. The seasonality trend of TB incidence was forecast to have a slightly increased seasonal TB incidence trend from the SARIMA-NNAR model compared to the single model. Conclusions: The combined model indicated a better TB incidence forecasting with a lower AICc. The model also indicates the need for resolute intervention to reduce infectious disease transmission with co-infection with HIV and other concomitant diseases, and also at festival peak periods.},

The causative agent is Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), whose main target are the macrophages, important immune system cells. Macrophages and T cell populations are the main responsible for fighting the pathogen. A better understanding of the interaction between Mtb, macrophages and T cells will contribute to the design of strategies to control TB. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of the response of T cells and macrophages in the control of Mtb. To this end, we propose a system of ordinary differential equations to model the interaction among non-infected macrophages, infected macrophages, T cells and Mtb bacilli. Model analysis reveals the existence of two equilibrium states, infection-free equilibrium and the endemically infected equilibrium which can represent a state of latent or active infection, depending on the amount of bacteria.},

abstract = {Background: Treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is complex, lengthy, and involves a minimum of four drugs termed a background regimen (BR), that have not previously been prescribed or that have proven susceptible to patient sputum culture isolates. In recent years, promising new treatment options have emerged as add-on therapies to a BR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term costs and effectiveness of adding the novel or group 5 interventions bedaquiline, delamanid, and linezolid to a background regimen (BR) of drugs for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), within their marketing authorisations, from a German healthcare cost-effectiveness perspective. Methods: A cohort-based Markov model was developed to simulate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of bedaquiline plus BR, delamanid plus BR, or linezolid plus BR versus BR alone in the treatment of MDR-TB, over a 10-year time horizon. Effectiveness of treatment was evaluated in Quality-Adjusted Life-Years (QALYs) and LifeYears Gained (LYG), using inputs from clinical trials for bedaquiline and delamanid and from a German observational study for linezolid. Cost data were obtained from German Drug Directory costs (epsilon/2015), published literature, and expert opinion. A 3{\%} yearly discount rate was applied. Probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses were conducted. Results: The total discounted costs per-patient were epsilon 85,575 for bedaquiline plus BR, epsilon 81,079 for delamanid plus BR, and epsilon 80,460 for linezolid plus BR, compared with a cost of epsilon 60,962 for BR alone. The total discounted QALYs per-patient were 5.95 for bedaquiline plus BR, 5.36 for delamanid plus BR, and 3.91 for linezolid plus BR, compared with 3.68 for BR alone. All interventions were therefore associated with higher QALYs and higher costs than BR alone, with incremental costs per QALY gained of epsilon 22,238 for bedaquiline, epsilon 38,703 for delamanid, and epsilon 87,484 for linezolid, versus BR alone. In a fully incremental analysis, bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment option at thresholds greater than epsilon 22,000 per QALY gained. In probabilistic analyses, the probability that bedaquiline plus BR was the most cost-effective treatment strategy at a willingness-to-pay threshold of epsilon 30,000 was 54.5{\%}, compared with 22.9{\%} for BR alone, 18.2{\%} for delamanid plus BR, and 4.4{\%} for linezolid. Conclusions: In Germany, the addition of bedaquiline, delamanid, or linezolid to a BR would result in QALY gains over BR alone. Based on this analysis, bedaquiline is likely to be the most cost-effective intervention for the treatment of MDRTB, when added to a BR regimen at thresholds greater than epsilon 22,000 per QALY.},

The efficacy of BCG in adults is particularly poor in tropical and subtropical regions.

abstract = {SETTING: No cost-effectiveness studies of testing for latent tuberculosis infection have incorporated both targeted testing and the use of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) in heterogeneous populations. OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of universal vs. targeted and sequential testing strategies and the use of tuberculin skin testing (TST) vs. IGRAs. DESIGN: Using a decision-analytic model, incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in 2009 among nine potential strategies for screening recruits. A societal perspective was taken over a 20-year analytic horizon, discounting future costs at 3{\%} annually. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to determine how changes in assumptions affected the estimates. RESULTS: Targeted strategies cost over US{\$}250 000 per case prevented, whereas universal testing strategies cost over US{\$}700 000 per incremental case prevented in base case and most sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Targeted testing offered the best value in this population, although it was still relatively expensive compared to no testing. Sequential testing with both TST and IGRAs provided a poor incremental value compared to targeted and universal testing strategies. Targeted testing using TST was slightly more cost-effective than targeted testing using either QuantiFERON(R)-TB Gold In-Tube or T-SPOT(R).TB, but these estimates were very sensitive to changes in model assumptions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To reduce global tuberculosis (TB) burden, the active disease must be diagnosed quickly and accurately and patients should be treated and cured. In Ethiopia, TB diagnosis mainly relies on spot-morning-spot (SMS) sputum sample smear analysis using Ziehl-Neelsen staining techniques (ZN). Since 2014 targeted use of xpert has been implemented. New diagnostic techniques have higher sensitivity and are likely to detect more cases if routinely implemented. The objective of our study was to project the effects of alternative diagnostic algorithms on the patient, health system, and costs, and identify cost-effective algorithms that increase TB case detection in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. METHODS: An observational quantitative modeling framework was applied using the Virtual Implementation approach. The model was designed to represent the operational and epidemiological context of Addis Ababa, the capital city of Ethiopia. We compared eight diagnostic algorithm with ZN microscopy, light emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy and Xpert MTB/RIF. Interventions with an annualized cost per averted disability adjusted life year (DALY) of less than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita are considered cost-effective interventions. RESULTS: With a cost lower than the average per-capita GDP (US{\$}690 for Ethiopia) for each averted disability adjusted life year (DALY), three of the modeled algorithms are cost-effective. Implementing them would have important patient, health system, and population-level effects in the context of Addis Ababa The full roll-out of Xpert MTB/RIF as the primary test for all presumptive TB cases would avert 91170 DALYs (95{\%} credible interval [CrI] 54888 - 127448) with an additional health system cost of US{\$} 11.6 million over the next 10 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is {\$}370 per DALY averted. Same day LED fluorescence microscopy for all presumptive TB cases combined with Xpert MTB/RIF targeted to HIV-positive and High multidrug resistant (MDR) risk groups would avert 73600 DALYs( 95{\%} CrI 48373 - 99214) with an additional cost of US{\$}5.1 million over the next 10 years. The ICER is {\$}169per DALY averted. Same-day LED fluorescence microscopy for all presumptive TB cases (and no Xpert MTB/RIF) would avert 43580 DALYs with a reduction cost of US{\$} 0.2 million over the next 10years. The ICER is {\$}13 per DALY averted. CONCLUSIONS: The full roll-out of Xpert MTB/RIF is predicted to be the best option to substantially reduce the TB burden in Addis Ababa and is considered cost effective. However, the investment cost to implement this is far beyond the budget of the national TB control program. Targeted use of Xpert MTB/RIF for HIV positive and high MDR risk groups with same-day LED fluorescence microscopy for all other presumptive TB cases is an affordable alternative.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to compare the direct costs of three models for detection of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) in routine clinical practice in Switzerland. Comparison of the overall costs of screening for LTBI, including medical and radiological examination, and preventive treatment associated with three screening models was carried out. Model 1 relies only on the tuberculin skin test (TST) according to the current national guidelines, model 2 relies on T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Oxford, UK) only and model 3 relies on TST followed by confirmation of positive results by T-SPOT.TB. Costs were taken directly from the clinic's figures. Clinical assumptions were based on the 267 patients who were referred to the clinic over the study period. Model 3 was found to be the most cost-effective. Using only the skin test (model 1) was the least cost-effective. If only one test for LTBI is to be used, then model 2 (using T-SPOT.TB only) is cheaper than using the TST (model 1). Screening for latent tuberculosis infection by tuberculin skin test followed by confirmation with T-SPOT.TB is less costly than screening with tuberculin skin test alone, as it allows a reduction in the number of people who receive preventive treatment. In groups with a high proportion of negative tuberculin skin tests, screening with T-SPOT.TB test only may be the most cost-effective.},

We show how network analysis has its roots in mathematics, statistics, sociology, anthropology, psychology, biology, physics, and computer science. In public health, network analysis has been used to study primarily disease transmission, especially for HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases; information transmission, particularly for diffusion of innovations; the role of social support and social capital; the influence of personal and social networks on health behavior; and the interorganizational structure of health systems.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Systematic screening is often proposed as a way to improve case finding for tuberculosis (TB), but the cost-effectiveness of specific strategies for systematic screening remains poorly studied. METHODS: We constructed a Markov-based decision analytic model to analyse the cost-effectiveness of triage testing for TB in Uganda, compared against passive case detection with Xpert MTB/RIF. We assumed a triage algorithm whereby all adults presenting to healthcare centres would be screened for cough, and those with cough of at least 2 weeks would receive the triage test, with positive triage results confirmed by Xpert MTB/RIF. We adopted the perspective of the TB control sector, using a primary outcome of the cost per year of life gained (YLG) over a lifetime time horizon. RESULTS: Systematic screening in a population with a 5{\%} underlying prevalence of TB was estimated to cost US{\$}610 per YLG (95{\%} uncertainty range US{\$}200-US{\$}1859) with chest X-ray (CXR) (US{\$}5 per test, specificity 0.67), or US{\$}588 (US{\$}221-US{\$}1746) with C reactive protein (CRP) (US{\$}3 per test, specificity 0.59). In addition to the cost and specificity of the triage test, cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the underlying prevalence of TB, monthly risk of mortality in people with untreated TB and the proportion of patients with TB who would be treated in the absence of systematic screening. CONCLUSIONS: To optimise the cost-effectiveness of facility-based systematic screening of TB with a triage test, it must be carried out in a high-risk population, or use triage tests that are cheaper or more specific than CXR or CRP.},

abstract = {During most infections, the population of immune cells known as macrophages are key to taking up and killing bacteria as an integral part of the immune response. However, during infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), host macrophages serve as the preferred environment for mycobacterial growth. Further, killing of Mtb by macrophages is impaired unless they become activated. Activation is induced by stimulation from bacterial antigens and inflammatory cytokines derived from helper T cells. The key macrophage-activating cytokines in Mtb infection are tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and interferon (IFN)-gamma. Due to differences in cellular sources and secretion pathways for TNF and IFN-gamma, the possibility of heterogeneous cytokine distributions exists, suggesting that the timing of macrophage activation from these signals may affect activation kinetics and thus impact the outcome of Mtb infection. Here we use a mathematical model to show that negative feedback from production of nitric oxide (the key mediator of mycobacterial killing) that typically optimizes macrophage responses to activating stimuli may reduce effective killing of Mtb. Statistical sensitivity analysis predicts that if TNF and IFN-gamma signals precede infection, the level of negative feedback may have a strong effect on how effectively macrophages kill Mtb. However, this effect is relaxed when IFN-gamma or TNF+IFN-gamma signals are received coincident with infection. Under these conditions, the model suggests that negative feedback induces fast responses and an initial overshoot of nitric oxide production for given doses of TNF and IFN-gamma, favoring killing of Mtb. Together, our results suggest that direct entry of macrophages into a granuloma site (and not distal to it) from lung vascular sources represents a preferred host strategy for mycobacterial control. We examine implications of these results in establishment of latent Mtb infection. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

To better understand the dynamics of Mtb infection and immunity, we have previously developed a temporal mathematical model that qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes the cellular and cytokine control network during infection. In this work we extend that model to a two compartmental model to capture the important processes of cellular activation and priming that occur between the lung and the nearest draining lymph node. We are able to reproduce typical disease progression scenarios including primary infection, latency or clearance. Then we use the model to predict key processes determining these different disease trajectories (i.e. identify bifurcation parameters), suggesting directions for further basic science study and potential new treatment strategies.},

@article{Hohmann2012,
abstract = {While in antiquity both leprosy and tuberculosis were prevalent in Europe, leprosy declined thereafter and, simultaneously, tuberculosis prevalence increased. Since both diseases are caused by mycobacterial infections, it has been suggested that there might be a causal relationship between both epidemics. Chaussinand observed the inverse prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis and suggested that individuals with a latent tuberculosis infection are protected from acquiring leprosy. His cross-immunity hypothesis has been countered more recently by a co-infection hypothesis. The latter suggestion, proposed by Donoghue, states that people being infected with multi-bacillary leprosy are more susceptible to tuberculosis, which leads to increased mortality from the disease. This study utilizes mathematical modeling to explore the epidemiological consequences of the co-infection hypothesis for realistically confined parameter values. While the co-infection hypothesis appears plausible at first glance, a second thought reveals that it comprises also substantial consequences for tuberculosis epidemics: if co-infection raises the mortality rate above that of purely tuberculosis infected persons, then tuberculosis might as well be eradicated by leprosy. It is the specific interplay of both increased susceptibility towards tuberculosis and increased death rate when co-infected that determines the epidemiological fate. As a result of this analysis, it is shown that there is a large parameter region where the eventual disappearance of leprosy could indeed be explained by co-infection. This parameter region is considerably larger than that predicted by the cross-immunity hypothesis. This shows that the co-infection hypothesis should be considered a significant alternative to the cross-immunity hypothesis. The time scales at which the effects of co-infection are observed depend critically on the spatial distribution of the individuals but reach epidemiologically realistic values for rather immobile individuals with local interaction.},

abstract = {Isoniazid, administered as part of combination antituberculosis therapy, is responsible for most of the early bactericidal activity (EBA) of the regimen. However, the emergence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis resistance to isoniazid is a major problem. We examined the relationship between isoniazid exposure and M. tuberculosis microbial kill, as well as the emergence of resistance, in our in vitro pharmacodynamic model of tuberculosis. Since single-nucleotide polymorphisms of the N-acetyltransferase-2 gene lead to two different clearances of isoniazid from serum in patients, we simulated the isoniazid concentration-time profiles encountered in both slow and fast acetylators. Both microbial kill and the emergence of resistance during monotherapy were associated with the ratio of the area under the isoniazid concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC(0-24)) to the isoniazid MIC. The time in mutant selection window hypothesis was rejected. Next, we utilized the in vitro relationship between the isoniazid AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio and microbial kill, the distributions of isoniazid clearance in populations with different percentages of slow and fast acetylators, and the distribution of isoniazid MICs for isonazid-susceptible M. tuberculosis clinical isolates in Monte Carlo simulations to calculate the EBA expected for approximately 10,000 patients treated with 300 mg of isoniazid. For those patient populations in which the proportion of fast acetylators and the isoniazid MICs were high, the average EBA of the standard dose was approximately 0.3 log(10) CFU/ml/day and was thus suboptimal. Our approach, which utilizes preclinical pharmacodynamics and the genetically determined multimodal distributions of serum clearances, is a preclinical tool that may be able to predict the EBAs of various doses of new antituberculosis drugs.},

The model includes both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. A detailed qualitative analysis about positivity, boundedness, existence, uniqueness and global stability of the equilibria of this model is carried out. Analytical results of the model show that the quantities R(1) and R(2), which represent the basic reproduction numbers of the sensitive and resistant strains, respectively, provide the threshold conditions which determine the competitive outcomes of the two strains. Numerical simulations are also conducted to confirm and extend the analytic results.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The field of diagnostics for active tuberculosis (TB) is rapidly developing. TB diagnostic modeling can help to inform policy makers and support complicated decisions on diagnostic strategy, with important budgetary implications. Demand for TB diagnostic modeling is likely to increase, and an evaluation of current practice is important. We aimed to systematically review all studies employing mathematical modeling to evaluate cost-effectiveness or epidemiological impact of novel diagnostic strategies for active TB. METHODS: Pubmed, personal libraries and reference lists were searched to identify eligible papers. We extracted data on a wide variety of model structure, parameter choices, sensitivity analyses and study conclusions, which were discussed during a meeting of content experts. RESULTS {\&} DISCUSSION: From 5619 records a total of 36 papers were included in the analysis. Sixteen papers included population impact/transmission modeling, 5 were health systems models, and 24 included estimates of cost-effectiveness. Transmission and health systems models included specific structure to explore the importance of the diagnostic pathway (n = 4), key determinants of diagnostic delay (n = 5), operational context (n = 5), and the pre-diagnostic infectious period (n = 1). The majority of models implemented sensitivity analysis, although only 18 studies described multi-way sensitivity analysis of more than 2 parameters simultaneously. Among the models used to make cost-effectiveness estimates, most frequent diagnostic assays studied included Xpert MTB/RIF (n = 7), and alternative nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) (n = 4). Most (n = 16) of the cost-effectiveness models compared new assays to an existing baseline and generated an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). CONCLUSION: Although models have addressed a small number of important issues, many decisions regarding implementation of TB diagnostics are being made without the full benefits of insight from mathematical models. Further models are needed that address a wider array of diagnostic and epidemiological settings, that explore the inherent uncertainty of models and that include additional epidemiological data on transmission implications of false-negative diagnosis and the pre-diagnostic period.},

abstract = {Cytology-based screening has reduced cervical cancer mortality in countries able to implement, sustain and financially support organized programs that achieve broad coverage. These ongoing secondary prevention efforts considerably complicate the question of whether vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 should be introduced. Policy questions focus primarily on the target ages of vaccination, appropriate ages for a temporary "catch-up" program, possible revisions in screening policies to optimize synergies with vaccination, including the increased used of HPV DNA testing, and the inclusion of boys in the vaccination program. Decision-analytic models are increasingly being developed to simulate disease burden and interventions in different settings in order to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary interventions for informed decision-making. This article is a focused review on existing mathematical models that have been used to evaluate HPV vaccination in the context of developed countries with existing screening programs. Despite variations in model assumptions and uncertainty in existing data, pre-adolescent vaccination of girls has been consistently found to be attractive in the context of current screening practices, provided there is complete and lifelong vaccine protection and widespread vaccination coverage. Questions related to catch-up vaccination programs, potential benefits of other non-cervical cancer outcomes and inclusion of boys are subject to far more uncertainty, and results from these analyses have reached conflicting conclusions. Most analyses find that some catch-up vaccination is warranted but becomes increasingly unattractive as the catch-up age is extended, and vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost-effective if reasonable levels of coverage are achieved in girls or coverage among girls can be improved. The objective of this review is to highlight points of consensus and qualitative themes, to discuss the areas of divergent findings, and to provide insight into critical decisions related to cervical cancer prevention. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Roeger2009b,
abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{\{}R1, R2{\}}. The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this model. We find that if R {\textless} 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textless} 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can coexist with HIV when R2 {\textgreater} 1. In other words, in the case when R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1 (or when R1 {\textgreater} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1), we are able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases with R2 {\textgreater} 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations, we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii) the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in the system.},

abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

abstract = {Background: While the overall population prevalence of tuberculosis in Quebec has been declining for many years, tuberculosis is still disproportionately more prevalent among the immigrant and Inuit communities. As such, the aim of this study was to forecast the incidence of tuberculosis in the Province of Quebec over time in order to examine the possible impact of future preventative and treatment programs geared to reducing such disparities. Methods: A compartmental differential equation based on a Susceptible Exposed Latent Infectious Recovered (SELIR) model was simulated using the Euler method using Visual Basic for Applications in Excel. Demographic parameters were obtained from census data for the Province of Quebec and the model was fitted to past epidemiological data to extrapolate future values over the period 2015 to 2030. Results: The trend of declining tuberculosis rates will continue in the general population, falling by 42{\%} by 2030. The incidence among immigrants will decrease but never vanish, and may increase in the future. Among the Inuit, the incidence is expected to increase, reaching a maximum and then stabilizing, although if re-infection is taken into account it may continue to increase. Tuberculosis among non-indigenous Canadian born persons will continue to decline, with the disease almost eradicated in that group in the mid 21st century. Conclusions: While the incidence of tuberculosis in the Province of Quebec is expected to decrease overall, certain populations will remain at risk.},

During that time, four programs of active case finding of TB were conducted as part of which a total of 944 homeless individuals were examined and 21 cases of active TB were detected. The objective of the present study was to find out whether the observed beneficial epidemiological trend could be a result of those programs. We addressed the issue of how the active case finding programs in the homeless community affected the TB incidence in the general population using a modified crisscross SIS-type (Susceptible - Infected - Susceptible) model which describes the dynamics of TB spread between the homeless and non-homeless populations. The values calculated from our model proved highly congruent with the actual epidemiological data. Our analysis showed a significant decline in TB incidence within 1 year of completion of each active case finding program. The model shows that each identified and cured case in the homeless community reduced the number of new cases in the general population by 3-4 within 1 year and by up to 20 within 5 years.},

Alveolar macrophages, as the primary host cell of this intracellular bacterium, play an important role in the course of disease. Vitamin D3 is known to have a potent effect on macrophage behavior during infection, modulating the production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines and immune effector molecules. In a vitamin D3 deficient host, the immune systems response to infection is greatly impaired. We used a quantitative systems biology approach to model the intracellular effects of vitamin D3 and compared our simulation output to our in vitro model of mycobacterium infection of macrophages in the presence and absence of Vitamin D3. Our in silico model results agreed with the in vitro assay results of interleukin-10, an anti-inflammatory protein whose production is known to be influenced by vitamin D3. This model will provide a platform for further investigation of the effects of vitamin D3 deficiency on host immune response to infection.},

XDR TB is now found in every region of the world, but appears most worrisome in the context of HIV and in resource-limited settings with congregate hospital wards. Here, we examine the emergence and transmission dynamics of the disease, incorporating the mathematical modelling literature related to airborne infection and epidemiological studies related to the operations of TB control programmes in resource-limited settings. We find that while XDR TB may present many challenges in the setting of resource constraints, the central problems highlighted by the emergence of XDR TB are those that have plagued TB programmes for years. These include a slow rate of case detection that permits prolonged infectiousness, the threat of airborne infection in enclosed spaces, the problem of inadequate treatment delivery and treatment completion, and the need to develop health systems that can address the combination of TB and poverty. Mathematical models of TB transmission shed light on the idea that community-based therapy and rapid detection systems may be beneficial in resource-limited settings, while congregate hospital wards are sites for major structural reform.},

Evidence accumulated to date indicates that regional differences in environmental mycobacteria are responsible for much of the variation observed between populations in the efficacy of BCG against pulmonary tuberculosis.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a growing problem worldwide, with an estimated third of the world's population currently infected. Of particular concern is the growing trend of dual epidemics of HIV and TB, with the associated multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Developed countries which had previously removed TB transmission from communities are being re-infected with the MDR-TB strains. In the USA, Centers for Disease Control {\&} Prevention (2009) estimate that treatment of a single case of MDR-TB costs approximately USD{\$}250,000, with a similar cost expected in Australia. TB is a complicated disease with different rates of progression to, and different aspects of, the clinically active disease. Approximately 5-10{\%} of those infected with TB develop 'fast' TB, and are expected to progress to clinically active TB within 2 years [Porco et al. 2001]. The remainder have 'slow' TB, and remain latently infected, with 5-10{\%} progressing to clinically active TB in 20 years [Blower et al. 1995]. Those with clinically active TB are further divided into extra-pulmonary (non-infectious) and pulmonary (able to infect others). Note those in the 'pulmonary' category may also have extra-pulmonary TB, but the reverse is not true. The control of TB spread is of paramount importance. The main intervention strategy adopted by the World Health Organisation (WHO) Stop TB program is the 'Directly Observed Treatment Short course' (DOTS) [World Health Organisation 2010]. Not all detection occurs under this program, but a significant amount of the treatment does, particularly for high burden countries. Therefore when considering interventions, we concentrate on the DOTS program, and do not consider other interventions here. We develop a population level model for TB transmission, with a focus on incorporating the WHO's DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) intervention program. The population is divided into 6 compartments, with 4 describing different stages of the disease (susceptible, latently infected, extrapulmonary, and pulmonary), and 2 for the DOTS intervention program (detection and treatment). This work has applications worldwide, but here we focus on the Torres Strait region where there is a high proportion of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). In particular, estimates suggest Papua New Guinea (PNG) may have the highest proportion of MDR-TB in the world [Gilpin et al. 2008], and the Torres Strait Islands could potentially act as a gateway for MDR-TB into mainland Australia. A sensitivity analysis is important in terms of both data collection and refinement, and in the context of understanding and informing the control of TB. To perform the sensitivity analysis the model needs to be run many times with different parameter values. Latin hypercube sampling is used to efficiently cover the parameter space, in conjunction with partial rank correlation coefficient to determine which parameters most influence the disease dynamics. The results show the most important parameter for TB in Papua New Guinea (PNG) is the rate of progression from latent to clinically active TB. Therefore, data refinement should concentrate on determining this rate as accurately as possible. The most important intervention parameter is the detection rate for the DOTS intervention program. This suggests an increase in DOTS coverage by even a small margin will result in a significant decrease in the incidence and prevalence of TB in PNG and other high burden countries.},

abstract = {The study of biological systems commonly depends on inferring the state of a 'hidden' variable, such as an underlying genotype, from that of an 'observed' variable, such as an expressed phenotype. However, this cannot be achieved using traditional quantitative methods when more than one genetic mechanism exists for a single observable phenotype. Using a novel latent class Bayesian model, it is possible to infer the prevalence of different genetic elements in a population given a sample of phenotypes. As an exemplar, data comprising phenotypic resistance to six antimicrobials obtained from passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 are analysed to infer the prevalence of individual resistance genes, as well as the prevalence of a genomic island known as SGI1 and its variants. Three competing models are fitted to the data and distinguished between using posterior predictive p-values to assess their ability to predict the observed number of unique phenotypes. The results suggest that several SGI1 variants circulate in a few fixed forms through the population from which our data were derived. The methods presented could be applied to other types of phenotypic data, and represent a useful and generic mechanism of inferring the genetic population structure of organisms.},

@article{Cohen2004b,
abstract = {Mathematical models have recently been used to predict the future burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). These models suggest the threat of multidrug resistance to TB control will depend on the relative 'fitness' of MDR strains and imply that if the average fitness of MDR strains is considerably less than that of drug-sensitive strains, the emergence of resistance will not jeopardize the success of tuberculosis control efforts. Multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis is conferred by the sequential acquisition of a number of different single-locus mutations that have been shown to have heterogeneous phenotypic effects. Here we model the impact of initial fitness estimates on the emergence of MDRTB assuming that the relative fitness of MDR strains is heterogeneous. We find that even when the average relative fitness of MDR strains is low and a well-functioning control program is in place, a small subpopulation of a relatively fit MDR strain may eventually outcompete both the drug-sensitive strains and the less fit MDR strains. These results imply that current epidemiological measures and short-term trends in the burden of MDRTB do not provide evidence that MDRTB strains can be contained in the absence of specific efforts to limit transmission from those with MDR disease.},

@article{Begun2013,
abstract = {The WHO recommended intervention of Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course (DOTS) appears to have been less successful than expected in reducing the burden of TB in some high prevalence settings. One strategy for enhancing DOTS is incorporating active case-finding through screening contacts of TB patients as widely used in low-prevalence settings. Predictive models that incorporate population-level effects on transmission provide one means of predicting impacts of such interventions. We aim to identify all TB transmission modelling studies addressing contact tracing and to describe and critically assess their modelling assumptions, parameter choices and relevance to policy. We searched MEDLINE, SCOPUS, COMPENDEX, Google Scholar and Web of Science databases for relevant English language publications up to February 2012. Of the 1285 studies identified, only 5 studies met our inclusion criteria of models of TB transmission dynamics in human populations designed to incorporate contact tracing as an intervention. Detailed implementation of contact processes was only present in two studies, while only one study presented a model for a high prevalence, developing world setting. Some use of relevant data for parameter estimation was made in each study however validation of the predicted impact of interventions was not attempted in any of the studies. Despite a large body of literature on TB transmission modelling, few published studies incorporate contact tracing. There is considerable scope for future analyses to make better use of data and to apply individual based models to facilitate more realistic patterns of infectious contact. Combined with a focus on high burden settings this would greatly increase the potential for models to inform the use of contract tracing as a TB control policy. Our findings highlight the potential for collaborative work between clinicians, epidemiologists and modellers to gather data required to enhance model development and validation and hence better inform future public health policy.},

abstract = {Recently developed molecular techniques have revolutionized the epidemiology of tuberculosis. Multiple studies have used these tools to examine the population structure of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates in different communities. The distributions of clusters of M. tuberculosis isolates in these settings may variously reflect social mixing patterns or the differential fitness of specific clones of the organism. We developed an individual-based microsimulation of tuberculosis transmission to explore social and demographic determinants of cluster distribution and to observe the effect of transmission dynamics on the empiric data from molecular epidemiologic studies. Our results demonstrate that multiple host-related factors contribute to wide variation in cluster distributions even when all strains of the organism are assumed to be equally transmissible. These host characteristics include interventions such as chemotherapy, vaccination and chemoprophylaxis, HIV prevalence, the age structure of the population, and the prevalence of latent tuberculosis infection. We consider the implications of these results for the interpretation of cluster studies of M. tuberculosis as well as the more general application of microsimulation models to infectious disease epidemiology.},

abstract = {Days to positivity in automated liquid mycobacterial culture have been shown to correlate with mycobacterial load and have been proposed as a useful biomarker for treatment responses in tuberculosis. However, there is currently no quantitative method or model to analyze the change in days to positivity with time on treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe the decline in numbers of mycobacteria in sputum collected once weekly for 8 weeks from patients on treatment for tuberculosis using days to positivity in liquid culture. One hundred forty-four patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited from a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. A nonlinear mixed-effects repeated-time-to-event modeling approach was used to analyze the time-to-positivity data. A biexponential model described the decline in the estimated number of bacteria in patients' sputum samples, while a logistic model with a lag time described the growth of the bacteria in liquid culture. At baseline, the estimated number of rapidly killed bacteria is typically 41 times higher than that of those that are killed slowly. The time to kill half of the rapidly killed bacteria was about 1.8 days, while it was 39 days for slowly killed bacteria. Patients with lung cavitation had higher bacterial loads than patients without lung cavitation. The model successfully described the increase in days to positivity as treatment progressed, differentiating between bacteria that are killed rapidly and those that are killed slowly. Our model can be used to analyze similar data from studies testing new drug regimens.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized trials assessing BCG vaccine protection against tuberculosis have widely varying results, for reasons that are not well understood. METHODS: We examined associations of trial setting and design with BCG efficacy against pulmonary and miliary or meningeal tuberculosis by conducting a systematic review, meta-analyses, and meta-regression. RESULTS: We identified 18 trials reporting pulmonary tuberculosis and 6 reporting miliary or meningeal tuberculosis. Univariable meta-regression indicated efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis varied according to 3 characteristics. Protection appeared greatest in children stringently tuberculin tested, to try to exclude prior infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or sensitization to environmental mycobacteria (rate ratio [RR], 0.26; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], .18-.37), or infants (RR, 0.41; 95{\%} CI, .29-.58). Protection was weaker in children not stringently tested (RR, 0.59; 95{\%} CI, .35-1.01) and older individuals stringently or not stringently tested (RR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI, .59-1.31 and RR, 0.81; 95{\%} CI, .55-1.22, respectively). Protection was higher in trials further from the equator where environmental mycobacteria are less and with lower risk of diagnostic detection bias. These associations were attenuated in a multivariable model, but each had an independent effect. There was no evidence that efficacy was associated with BCG strain. Protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis was also high in infants (RR, 0.1; 95{\%} CI, .01-.77) and children stringently tuberculin tested (RR, 0.08; 95{\%} CI, .03-.25). CONCLUSIONS: Absence of prior M. tuberculosis infection or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria is associated with higher efficacy of BCG against pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly against miliary and meningeal tuberculosis. Evaluations of new tuberculosis vaccines should account for the possibility that prior infection may mask or block their effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB), caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) [(Zopf 1883) Lehmann and Neumann 1896], is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Nearly one-third of the world's population is infected with MTB; TB has an annual incidence of 9 million new cases and each year causes 2 million deaths worldwide. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of screening tests [interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin tests (TSTs)] in latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) diagnosis to support National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guideline development for three population groups: children, immunocompromised people and those who have recently arrived in the UK from high-incidence countries. All of these groups are at higher risk of progression from LTBI to active TB. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, EMBASE, The Cochrane Library and Current Controlled Trials were searched from December 2009 up to December 2014. REVIEW METHODS: English-language studies evaluating the comparative effectiveness of commercially available tests used for identifying LTBI in children, immunocompromised people and recent arrivals to the UK were eligible. Interventions were IGRAs [QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold (QFT-G), QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold-In-Tube (QFT-GIT) (Cellestis/Qiagen, Carnegie, VA, Australia) and T-SPOT.TB (Oxford Immunotec, Abingdon, UK)]. The comparator was TST 5 mm or 10 mm alone or with an IGRA. Two independent reviewers screened all identified records and undertook a quality assessment and data synthesis. A de novo model, structured in two stages, was developed to compare the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic strategies. RESULTS: In total, 6687 records were screened, of which 53 unique studies were included (a further 37 studies were identified from a previous NICE guideline). The majority of the included studies compared the strength of association for the QFT-GIT/G IGRA with the TST (5 mm or 10 mm) in relation to the incidence of active TB or previous TB exposure. Ten studies reported evidence on decision-analytic models to determine the cost-effectiveness of IGRAs compared with the TST for LTBI diagnosis. In children, TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) negative followed by QFT-GIT was the most cost-effective strategy, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of pound18,900 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. In immunocompromised people, QFT-GIT negative followed by the TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) was the most cost-effective strategy, with an ICER of approximately pound18,700 per QALY gained. In those recently arrived from high TB incidence countries, the TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) alone was less costly and more effective than TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) positive followed by QFT-GIT or T-SPOT.TB or QFT-GIT alone. LIMITATIONS: The limitations and scarcity of the evidence, variation in the exposure-based definitions of LTBI and heterogeneity in IGRA performance relative to TST limit the applicability of the review findings. CONCLUSIONS: Given the current evidence, TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) negative followed by QFT-GIT for children, QFT-GIT negative followed by TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) for the immunocompromised population and TST ({\textgreater}/= 5 mm) for recent arrivals were the most cost-effective strategies for diagnosing LTBI that progresses to active TB. These results should be interpreted with caution given the limitations identified. The evidence available is limited and more high-quality research in this area is needed including studies on the inconsistent performance of tests in high-compared with low-incidence TB settings; the prospective assessment of progression to active TB for those at high risk; the relative benefits of two-compared with one-step testing with different tests; and improved classification of people at high and low risk for LTBI.

abstract = {This set of modules is not aimed at quantitative analysis; we rather expect most users will have some familiarity with many basic ideas and some prior experience of traditional elementary statistical methods, but may need these ideas refreshing- and there may be some topics which users feel they have not yet fully understood. In Modules 1 and 2 therefore we present quite selective overviews of some crucial topics rather than re-invent a basic statistics course. We will initially rarely go into any technical detail and the presentation will be mainly on ideas supported by concrete examples. The focus is on key topics that will help to contextualise the ultimate task of learning about multilevel models. For readers requiring a thorough preliminary coverage of basic statistical ideas or more in-depth treatment of some of the key ideas to be presented in this module and the next there are a number of on-line resources and texts that may be consulted, which are listed in the Resources section In Module 1 we will look at quantitative research and how we collect data, in order to provide a firm foundation for the analyses covered in later modules (ultimately, of course, for multilevel modelling, introduced in Modules 4 {\&} 5). In more detail, the aims of Module 1 are: • To give a broad overview of how research questions might be answered through quantitative analysis. Such questions as the following are explored: How does quantitative analysis relate to other methods of inquiry? Why is it required and what sorts of evidence can it supply? • To introduce the vocabulary of quantitative analysis and specify the common terminology to be used in later modules. Of particular importance is the operational definition of research concepts (how we get from real world},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to estimate the cost-effectiveness of treating patients infected with HIV and simultaneously coinfected with tuberculosis (TB) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: A mathematical model for HIV coinfection with TB and HCV is introduced. The model was designed to incorporate parameters of control for the coverage of care, which makes it useful for performing cost-effectiveness analysis of public policies. A cost-effectiveness analysis of early medical care of patients with TB and HCV coinfection, with coverage of 0 (basal), 25, 50, 75 and 100{\%}, was performed for the whole cohort of patients and a special analysis was performed in a selected population with triple infection. RESULTS: The cost per resolved infection and the cost per year of life gained were found to be very cost-effective for the population with triple infection, for all different coverages. CONCLUSIONS: It is known that treating patients with HIV who are coinfected with TB or HCV implies high cost and low efficacy, but it is possible that the population with triple infections could achieve important benefits in terms of years of life gained.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: From 2012 through 2014, the United States experienced acute shortages and price escalations of several first-line anti-tuberculosis (TB) medications. Because secondary TB drug regimens are longer and adverse events occur more frequently with them, we sought to conservatively estimate the cost, to patients and the health care system, of TB treatment and medication adverse events from alternative regimens during drug shortages. METHODS: We assessed the cost of treatment for TB disease in the absence of isoniazid (INH), rifampin (RIF), or pyrazinamide (PZA), or both INH and RIF. We simulated adverse events based on published probabilities using a monthly discrete-time stochastic model. For total costs, we summed costs of medications, routine testing, and treatment of adverse events using procedural terminology codes. We report average cost ratios of TB treatment during drug shortages to standard TB treatment. RESULTS: The cost ratio of TB treatment without INH, RIF, or PZA to standard treatment was 1.7 (Range: 1.2, 2.3), 4.9 (Range: 3.2, 7.3), and 1.1 (Range: 0.7, 1.7) times higher, respectively. Without both INH and RIF, the cost ratio was 18.6 (Range: 10.0, 39.0) times higher. When the prices for INH, RIF and PZA were increased, the cost for standard treatment increased by a factor of 2.7 (Range: 1.9, 3.0). The percentage of patients experiencing at least one adverse event while taking standard therapy was 3.9{\%} (Range: 1.3{\%}, 11.8{\%}). This percentage increased to 51.5{\%} (Range: 20.1{\%}, 83.8{\%}) when RIF was unavailable, and increased to 82.5{\%} (Range: 41.2{\%}, 98.5{\%}) when both INH and RIF were unavailable. CONCLUSIONS: Our conservative model illustrates that an interruption in first-line anti-TB medications leads to appreciable additional costs and adverse events for patients. The availability of these drugs in the United States should be ensured. Models that incorporate the effectiveness of alternative regimens, delays in treatment initiation, and TB transmission can provide broader perspectives on the impact of drug shortages.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Immigrants to the U.S. are required to undergo overseas screening for tuberculosis (TB), but the value of evaluation and treatment following entry to the U.S. is not well understood. We determined the cost-effectiveness of domestic follow-up of immigrants identified as tuberculosis suspects through overseas screening. METHODS: Using a stochastic simulation for tuberculosis reactivation, transmission, and follow-up for a hypothetical cohort of 1000 individuals, we calculated the incremental cost-effectiveness of follow-up and evaluation interventions. We utilized published literature, California Reports of Verified Cases of Tuberculosis (RVCTs), demographic estimates from the California Department of Finance, Medicare reimbursement, and Medi-Cal reimbursement rates. Our target population was legal immigrants to the United States, our time horizon is twenty years, and our perspective was that of all domestic health-care payers. We examined the intervention to offer latent tuberculosis therapy to infected individuals, to increase the yield of domestic evaluation, and to increase the starting and completion rates of LTBI therapy with INH (isoniazid). Our outcome measures were the number of cases averted, the number of deaths averted, the incremental dollar cost (year 2004), and the number of quality-adjusted life-years saved. RESULTS: Domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment for latently infected individuals, is highly cost-effective, and at times, cost-saving. B-notification follow-up in California would reduce the number of new tuberculosis cases by about 6-26 per year (out of a total of approximately 3000). Sensitivity analysis revealed that domestic follow-up remains cost-effective when the hepatitis rates due to INH therapy are over fifteen times our best estimates, when at least 0.4 percent of patients have active disease and when hospitalization of cases detected through domestic follow-up is no less likely than hospitalization of passively detected cases. CONCLUSION: While the current immigration screening program is unlikely to result in a large change in case rates, domestic follow-up of B-notification patients, including LTBI treatment, is highly cost-effective. If as many as three percent of screened individuals have active TB, and early detection reduces the rate of hospitalization, net savings may be expected.},

abstract = {This study illustrates the use of disease modeling and simulation techniques to the study of the spread of disease within and between social networks. A Reed-Frost type model of disease spread is used to construct a simulation of the spread of tuberculosis within three prehistoric populations of the Lower Illinois River Valley during Middle Woodland, Late Woodland, and Mississippian times. A high and low population size was modeled for each time period. Late Woodland model 2 (low population estimate) is the only model that experienced pathogen extinction with host survival. The rest of the models experienced rapid and severe host population decline. The results of the simulation suggest that a social network size of between 180 and 440 persons is required under the conditions of this model for host-pathogen coexistence (i.e., endemicity) to occur. The severe population decline experienced by these populations suggests that tuberculosis as modeled here could not have existed in these populations. Future refinements of modeling and simulation techniques can provide additional insights into how disease spreads among social contacts.},

@article{Lipsitch1997,
abstract = {For tuberculosis and number of other bacterial infections, treatment with a single antimicrobial drug frequently fails due to the ascent of mutants resistant to that drug. To minimize the likelihood of this occurrence, multiple drugs with independent resistance mechanisms are used simultaneously. None the less, multiply resistant bacteria sometimes emerge even when patients are simultaneously treated with two or more drugs, and the ascent of these multiply-resistant mutants may result in treatment failure in the patient and spread of these resistant bacteria to other hosts. We consider two mathematical models of antibacterial chemotherapy which can account for the ascent of multiple antibiotic resistance within hosts treated with multiple antibiotics. In both, multiple resistance evolves because of selection favouring mutants resistant to fewer than all of the chemotherapeutic agents employed, intermediates. In one model, this occurs because of temporal fluctuations in the concentrations of the antibiotics in the course of normal treatment and/or because of non-adherence to the treatment regime. In the other, intermediates are favoured and multiple resistance evolves because of tissue and somatic cell heterogeneity. In the effective concentrations of the antibiotics and physiological variation in the sensitivity of subpopulations of bacteria to different antibiotics. We discuss the limitations (and assets) of this model and approach and the implications for the design of antibiotic treatment regimes. Finally, we consider how the assumptions behind this model and the predictions made from its analysis could be tested experimentally.},

Here we bypass the conventional human-disease models, and propose that bubonic plague is driven by the dynamics of the disease in the rat population. Using a stochastic, spatial metapopulation model, we show that bubonic plague can persist in relatively small rodent populations from which occasional human epidemics arise, without the need for external imports. This explains why historically the plague persisted despite long disease-free periods, and how the disease re-occurred in cities with tight quarantine control. In a contemporary setting, we show that human vaccination cannot eradicate the plague, and that culling of rats may prevent or exacerbate human epidemics, depending on the timing of the cull. The existence of plague reservoirs in wild rodent populations has important public-health implications for the transmission to urban rats and the subsequent risk of human outbreaks.},

abstract = {Motivation: A mathematical model to describe the immune response and different chemotherapeutic regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) has been developed. The model can be used as a tool for predicting the course of the infectious process and outcomes in individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MBT). To identify what chemotherapeutic regimen is the best, one should clearly understand how different anti-TB drugs work. One of the most promising approaches to elaborate optimal anti-TB chemotherapeutic treatment/regimen is the gene-network technology. Results: The model proposed herein consists of a set of ordinary differential equations for the dynamics of diverse populations of bacteria, macrophages, T lymphocytes, dendrite cells as well as for various concentrations of cytokines and antibacterial drugs. Different treatment regimens in individuals with different variants of the course of disease (latent and acute infection) were simulated, and so were different rates of drug inactivation (rapid and slow acetylators). Different regimes of the model, which yield different outcomes, correspond to different chemotherapeutic regimens, which either give recovery (adequate chemotherapy) or delay recovery and contribute to the emergence of drug-resistant strains (inadequate chemotherapy). A further progression of the model will be connected with optimization of the treatment regimens for TB. To serve the purpose, we have reconstructed the gene network for the mechanisms of anti-TB drugs and for the mechanisms underlying the emergence of drug resistance developed by MBT due to mutation in separate target genes.},

abstract = {Measurement error in explanatory variables and unmeasured confounders can cause considerable problems in epidemiologic studies. It is well recognized that under certain conditions, nondifferential measurement error in the exposure variable produces bias towards the null. Measurement error in confounders will lead to residual confounding, but this is not a straightforward issue, and it is not clear in which direction the bias will point. Unmeasured confounders further complicate matters. There has been discussion about the amount of bias in exposure effect estimates that can plausibly occur due to residual or unmeasured confounding. In this paper, the authors use simulation studies and logistic regression analyses to investigate the size of the apparent exposure-outcome association that can occur when in truth the exposure has no causal effect on the outcome. The authors consider two cases with a normally distributed exposure and either two or four normally distributed confounders. When the confounders are uncorrelated, bias in the exposure effect estimate increases as the amount of residual and unmeasured confounding increases. Patterns are more complex for correlated confounders. With plausible assumptions, effect sizes of the magnitude frequently reported in observational epidemiologic studies can be generated by residual and/or unmeasured confounding alone.},

abstract = {Multiple immune factors control host responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including the formation of granulomas, which are aggregates of immune cells whose function may reflect success or failure of the host to contain infection. One such factor is TNF-alpha. TNF-alpha has been experimentally characterized to have the following activities in M. tuberculosis infection: macrophage activation, apoptosis, and chemokine and cytokine production. Availability of TNF-alpha within a granuloma has been proposed to play a critical role in immunity to M. tuberculosis. However, in vivo measurement of a TNF-alpha concentration gradient and activities within a granuloma are not experimentally feasible. Further, processes that control TNF-alpha concentration and activities in a granuloma remain unknown. We developed a multiscale computational model that includes molecular, cellular, and tissue scale events that occur during granuloma formation and maintenance in lung. We use our model to identify processes that regulate TNF-alpha concentration and cellular behaviors and thus influence the outcome of infection within a granuloma. Our model predicts that TNF-alphaR1 internalization kinetics play a critical role in infection control within a granuloma, controlling whether there is clearance of bacteria, excessive inflammation, containment of bacteria within a stable granuloma, or uncontrolled growth of bacteria. Our results suggest that there is an interplay between TNF-alpha and bacterial levels in a granuloma that is controlled by the combined effects of both molecular and cellular scale processes. Finally, our model elucidates processes involved in immunity to M. tuberculosis that may be new targets for therapy.},

abstract = {To determine the incremental cost of directly observed therapy (DOT) for patients with tuberculosis at low risk for treatment default, we applied a model of DOT effectiveness to 1,377 low-risk patients in California during 1995. The default rate for this cohort, which consisted of those with no recent history of substance abuse, homelessness, or incarceration, was 1.7{\%}. The model predicted that DOT and self-administered therapy (SAT) cured 93.1 and 90.8{\%} of these patients, respectively. DOT would initially cost {\$}1.83 million more than SAT, but avert {\$}569,191 in treatment cost for relapse cases and their contacts, for a net incremental cost of {\$}1.27 million ({\$}919 per patient treated), or {\$}40,620 per additional case cured. The cost-effectiveness of DOT was sensitive to the default rate and relapse rate after completing SAT. DOT would generate cost savings only when the default and relapse rates were more than 32.2 and 9.2{\%}, respectively. Given the low default rate and resulting high incremental cost of DOT, provision of DOT to low-risk patients in California should be evaluated in the context of resource availability, competing program priorities, and program success in completing self-administered therapy with a low relapse rate.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We estimated the incremental cost and impact on diagnosis and treatment uptake of national rollout of Xpert MTB/RIF technology (Xpert) for the diagnosis of pulmonary TB above the cost of current guidelines for the years 2011 to 2016 in South Africa. METHODS: We parameterised a population-level decision model with data from national-level TB databases (n = 199,511) and implementation studies. The model follows cohorts of TB suspects from diagnosis to treatment under current diagnostic guidelines or an algorithm that includes Xpert. Assumptions include the number of TB suspects, symptom prevalence of 5.5{\%}, annual suspect growth rate of 10{\%}, and 2010 public-sector salaries and drug and service delivery costs. Xpert test costs are based on data from an in-country pilot evaluation and assumptions about when global volumes allowing cartridge discounts will be reached. RESULTS: At full scale, Xpert will increase the number of TB cases diagnosed per year by 30{\%}-37{\%} and the number of MDR-TB cases diagnosed by 69{\%}-71{\%}. It will diagnose 81{\%} of patients after the first visit, compared to 46{\%} currently. The cost of TB diagnosis per suspect will increase by 55{\%} to USD 60-61 and the cost of diagnosis and treatment per TB case treated by 8{\%} to USD 797-873. The incremental capital cost of the Xpert scale-up will be USD 22 million and the incremental recurrent cost USD 287-316 million over six years. CONCLUSION: Xpert will increase both the number of TB cases diagnosed and treated and the cost of TB diagnosis. These results do not include savings due to reduced transmission of TB as a result of earlier diagnosis and treatment initiation.},

abstract = {Healthcare workers (HCWs) in low-incidence settings are often serially tested for latent TB infection (LTBI) with the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT) assay, which exhibits frequent conversions and reversions. The clinical impact of such variability on serial testing remains unknown. We used a microsimulation Markov model that accounts for major sources of variability to project diagnostic outcomes in a simulated North American HCW cohort. Serial testing using a single QFT with the recommended conversion cutoff (IFN-g {\textgreater} 0.35 IU/mL) resulted in 24.6{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range, UR: 23.8-25.5) of the entire population testing false-positive over ten years. Raising the cutoff to {\textgreater} 1.0 IU/mL or confirming initial positive results with a (presumed independent) second test reduced this false-positive percentage to 2.3{\%} (95{\%} UR: 2.0-2.6{\%}) or 4.1{\%} (95{\%} UR: 3.7-4.5{\%}), but also reduced the proportion of true incident infections detected within the first year of infection from 76.5{\%} (95{\%} UR: 66.3-84.6{\%}) to 54.8{\%} (95{\%} UR: 44.6-64.5{\%}) or 61.5{\%} (95{\%} UR: 51.6-70.9{\%}), respectively. Serial QFT testing of HCWs in North America may result in tremendous over-diagnosis and over-treatment of LTBI, with nearly thirty false-positives for every true infection diagnosed. Using higher cutoffs for conversion or confirmatory tests (for initial positives) can mitigate these effects, but will also diagnose fewer true infections.},

The bulk of economic evaluations of vaccination programs continue to use models that cannot take into account the indirect effects produced by herd-immunity. Here, the authors illustrate the importance of incorporating herd-immunity externalities when assessing the cost-effectiveness of vaccination progams. To do this, they compare 2 methods of estimating the benefits of routine mass vaccination: one that includes herd-immunity (dynamic approach) and one that does not (static approach). Finally, they use the results to clarify a number of misconceptions that are common in the literature concerning herd-immunity and dynamical effects produced by models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Little is known about how long the BCG vaccine protects against tuberculosis. We assessed the long-term vaccine effectiveness (VE) in Norwegian-born individuals. METHODS In this retrospective population-based cohort study, we studied Norwegian-born individuals aged 12-50 years who were tuberculin skin test (TST) negative and eligible for BCG vaccination as part of the last round of Norway's mandatory mass tuberculosis screening and BCG vaccination programme between 1962 and 1975. We excluded individuals who had tuberculosis before or in the year of screening and those with unknown TST and BCG status. We obtained TST and BCG information and linked it to the National Tuberculosis Register, population and housing censuses, and the population register for emigrations and deaths. We followed individuals up to their first tuberculosis episode, emigration, death, or Dec 31, 2011. We used Cox regressions to estimate VE against all tuberculosis and just pulmonary tuberculosis by time since vaccination, adjusted for age, time, county-level tuberculosis rates, and demographic and socioeconomic indicators. FINDINGS Median follow-up was 41 years (IQR 32-49) for 83 421 BCG-unvaccinated and 44 years (41-46) for 297 905 vaccinated individuals, with 260 tuberculosis episodes. Tuberculosis rates were 3{\textperiodcentered}3 per 100 000 person-years in unvaccinated and 1{\textperiodcentered}3 per 100 000 person-years in vaccinated individuals. The adjusted average VE during 40 year follow-up was 49{\%} (95{\%} CI 26-65), although after 20 years, the VE was not significant (up to 9 years VE [excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years] 61{\%} [95{\%} CI 24-80]; 10-19 years 58{\%} [27-76]; 20-29 years 38{\%} [-32 to 71]; 30-40 years 42{\%} [-24 to 73]). VE against pulmonary tuberculosis up to 9 years (excluding tuberculosis episodes in the first 2 years) was 67{\%} (95{\%} CI 27-85), 10-19 years was 63{\%} (32-80), 20-29 years was 50{\%} (-19 to 79), and 30-40 years was 40{\%} (-46 to 76).

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The current understanding of airborne tuberculosis (TB) transmission is based on classic 1950s studies in which guinea pigs were exposed to air from a tuberculosis ward. Recently we recreated this model in Lima, Peru, and in this paper we report the use of molecular fingerprinting to investigate patient infectiousness in the current era of HIV infection and multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: All air from a mechanically ventilated negative-pressure HIV-TB ward was exhausted over guinea pigs housed in an airborne transmission study facility on the roof. Animals had monthly tuberculin skin tests, and positive reactors were removed for autopsy and organ culture for M. tuberculosis. Temporal exposure patterns, drug susceptibility testing, and DNA fingerprinting of patient and animal TB strains defined infectious TB patients. Relative patient infectiousness was calculated using the Wells-Riley model of airborne infection. Over 505 study days there were 118 ward admissions of 97 HIV-positive pulmonary TB patients. Of 292 exposed guinea pigs, 144 had evidence of TB disease; a further 30 were tuberculin skin test positive only. There was marked variability in patient infectiousness; only 8.5{\%} of 118 ward admissions by TB patients were shown by DNA fingerprinting to have caused 98{\%} of the 125 characterised cases of secondary animal TB. 90{\%} of TB transmission occurred from inadequately treated MDR TB patients. Three highly infectious MDR TB patients produced 226, 52, and 40 airborne infectious units (quanta) per hour. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of inadequately treated MDR TB patients coinfected with HIV were responsible for almost all TB transmission, and some patients were highly infectious. This result highlights the importance of rapid TB drug-susceptibility testing to allow prompt initiation of effective treatment, and environmental control measures to reduce ongoing TB transmission in crowded health care settings. TB infection control must be prioritized in order to prevent health care facilities from disseminating the drug-resistant TB that they are attempting to treat.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) tuberculosis can be acquired through de-novo mutation during tuberculosis treatment or through transmission from other individuals with active MDR tuberculosis. Understanding the balance between these two mechanisms is essential when allocating resources for MDR tuberculosis. We aimed to create a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic to estimate the contributions of treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance to incident MDR tuberculosis cases. METHODS: In this modelling analysis, we constructed a dynamic transmission model of an MDR tuberculosis epidemic, allowing for both treatment-related acquisition and person-to-person transmission of resistance. We used national tuberculosis notification data to inform Bayesian estimates of the proportion of each country's 2013 MDR tuberculosis incidence that resulted from MDR transmission rather than treatment-related MDR acquisition. FINDINGS: Global estimates of 3.5{\%} MDR tuberculosis prevalence among new tuberculosis notifications and 20.5{\%} among re-treatment notifications translate into an estimate that resistance transmission rather than acquisition accounts for a median 95.9{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range [UR] 68.0-99.6) of all incident MDR tuberculosis, and 61.3{\%} (16.5-95.2) of incident MDR tuberculosis in previously treated individuals. The estimated proportion of MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission varied substantially with different countries' notification data-ranging from 48{\%} (95{\%} UR 30-75) in Bangladesh to 99{\%} (91-100) in Uzbekistan. Estimates were most sensitive to estimates of the transmissibility of MDR strains, the probability of acquiring MDR during tuberculosis treatment, and the responsiveness of MDR tuberculosis to first-line treatment. INTERPRETATION: Notifications of MDR prevalence from most high-burden settings are consistent with most incident MDR tuberculosis resulting from transmission rather than new treatment-related acquisition of resistance. Merely improving the treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis is unlikely to greatly reduce future MDR tuberculosis incidence. Improved diagnosis and treatment of MDR tuberculosis-including new tests and drug regimens-should be highly prioritised.

abstract = {The number of cattle herds placed under movement restrictions in Great Britain (GB) due to the suspected presence of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) has progressively increased over the past 25 years despite an intensive and costly test-and-slaughter control program. Around 38{\%} of herds that clear movement restrictions experience a recurrent incident (breakdown) within 24 months, suggesting that infection may be persisting within herds. Reactivity to tuberculin, the basis of diagnostic testing, is dependent on the time from infection. Thus, testing efficiency varies between outbreaks, depending on weight of transmission and cannot be directly estimated. In this paper, we use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) to parameterize two within-herd transmission models within a rigorous inferential framework. Previous within-herd models of bTB have relied on ad-hoc methods of parameterization and used a single model structure (SORI) where animals are assumed to become detectable by testing before they become infectious. We study such a conventional within-herd model of bTB and an alternative model, motivated by recent animal challenge studies, where there is no period of epidemiological latency before animals become infectious (SOR). Under both models we estimate that cattle-to-cattle transmission rates are non-linearly density dependent. The basic reproductive ratio for our conventional within-herd model, estimated for scenarios with no statutory controls, increases from 1.5 (0.26-4.9; 95{\%} CI) in a herd of 30 cattle up to 4.9 (0.99-14.0) in a herd of 400. Under this model we estimate that 50{\%} (33-67) of recurrent breakdowns in Britain can be attributed to infection missed by tuberculin testing. However this figure falls to 24{\%} (11-42) of recurrent breakdowns under our alternative model. Under both models the estimated extrinsic force of infection increases with the burden of missed infection. Hence, improved herd-level testing is unlikely to reduce recurrence unless this extrinsic infectious pressure is simultaneously addressed.},

abstract = {A two-strain tuberculosis (TB) transmission model incorporating antibiotic-generated TB resistant strains and long and variable waiting periods within the latently infected class is introduced. The mathematical analysis is carried out when the waiting periods are modeled via parametrically friendly gamma distributions, a reasonable alternative to the use of exponential distributed waiting periods or to integral equations involving ``arbitrary'' distributions. The model supports a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when the reproduction number is less than one and an endemic equilibriums, shown to be locally asymptotically stable, or l.a.s., whenever the basic reproduction number is greater than one. Conditions for the existence and maintenance of TB resistant strains are discussed. The possibility of exogenous re-infection is added and shown to be capable of supporting multiple equilibria; a situation that increases the challenges faced by public health experts. We show that exogenous re-infection may help established resilient communities of actively-TB infected individuals that cannot be eliminated using approaches based exclusively on the ability to bring the control reproductive number just below 1.},

@article{Cummings2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increase in the average age of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) cases has been reported in Thailand. The cause of this increase is not known. Possible explanations include a reduction in transmission due to declining mosquito populations, declining contact between human and mosquito, and changes in reporting. We propose that a demographic shift toward lower birth and death rates has reduced dengue transmission and lengthened the interval between large epidemics. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Using data from each of the 72 provinces of Thailand, we looked for associations between force of infection (a measure of hazard, defined as the rate per capita at which susceptible individuals become infected) and demographic and climactic variables. We estimated the force of infection from the age distribution of cases from 1985 to 2005. We find that the force of infection has declined by 2{\%} each year since a peak in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Contrary to recent findings suggesting that the incidence of DHF has increased in Thailand, we find a small but statistically significant decline in DHF incidence since 1985 in a majority of provinces. The strongest predictor of the change in force of infection and the mean force of infection is the median age of the population. Using mathematical simulations of dengue transmission we show that a reduced birth rate and a shift in the population's age structure can explain the shift in the age distribution of cases, reduction of the force of infection, and increase in the periodicity of multiannual oscillations of DHF incidence in the absence of other changes. CONCLUSIONS: Lower birth and death rates decrease the flow of susceptible individuals into the population and increase the longevity of immune individuals. The increase in the proportion of the population that is immune increases the likelihood that an infectious mosquito will feed on an immune individual, reducing the force of infection. Though the force of infection has decreased by half, we find that the critical vaccination fraction has not changed significantly, declining from an average of 85{\%} to 80{\%}. Clinical guidelines should consider the impact of continued increases in the age of dengue cases in Thailand. Countries in the region lagging behind Thailand in the demographic transition may experience the same increase as their population ages. The impact of demographic changes on the force of infection has been hypothesized for other diseases, but, to our knowledge, this is the first observation of this phenomenon.

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine tuberculosis (TB) population dynamics and to assess potential infection risk in Taiwan. A well-established mathematical model of TB transmission built on previous models was adopted to study the potential impact of TB transmission. A probabilistic risk model was also developed to estimate site-specific risks of developing disease soon after recent primary infection, exogenous reinfection, or through endogenous reactivation (latently infected TB) among Taiwan regions. Here, we showed that the proportion of endogenous reactivation (53-67{\%}) was larger than that of exogenous reinfection (32-47{\%}). Our simulations showed that as epidemic reaches a steady state, age distribution of cases would finally shift toward older age groups dominated by latently infected TB cases as a result of endogenous reactivation. A comparison of age-weighted TB incidence data with our model simulation output with 95{\%} credible intervals revealed that the predictions were in an apparent agreement with observed data. The median value of overall basic reproduction number (R(0) ) in eastern Taiwan ranged from 1.65 to 1.72, whereas northern Taiwan had the lowest R(0) estimate of 1.50. We found that total TB incidences in eastern Taiwan had 25-27{\%} probabilities of total proportion of infected population exceeding 90{\%}, whereas there were 36-66{\%} probabilities having exceeded 20{\%} of total proportion of infected population attributed to latently infected TB. We suggested that our Taiwan-based analysis can be extended to the context of developing countries, where TB remains a substantial cause of elderly morbidity and mortality.},

A corresponding web-based interface allows users to specify local costs and epidemiology. In settings with little capacity for up-front investment, same-day microscopy had the greatest impact on TB incidence and became cost-saving within 5 years if delivered at {\$}10/test. With greater initial investment, population-level scale-up of Xpert MTB/RIF or microcolony-based culture often averted 10 times more TB cases than narrowly-targeted strategies, at minimal incremental long-term cost. Xpert for smear-positive TB had reasonable impact on MDR-TB incidence, but at substantial price and little impact on overall TB incidence and mortality.

An estimated 88 million new cases of tuberculosis, of which 8 million will be attributable to HIV infection, will occur in the world during the decade; 30 million people are predicted to die of tuberculosis in the same period, including 2.9 million attributable to HIV infection. The number of new tuberculosis cases occurring each year is predicted to increase from 7.5 million (143 cases per 100,000) in 1990 to 8.8 million (152 per 100,000) in 1995 and 10.2 million (163 per 100,000) in the year 2000. In 1990, 2.5 million persons were estimated to have died of tuberculosis; at the same level of availability of treatment, it is predicted that 3.0 million tuberculosis deaths will occur in 1995 and 3.5 million in 2000. Demographic factors, such as population growth and changes in the age structure of populations, will account for 79.5{\%} of the predicted increases in new cases. Age-specific incidence rates in sub-Saharan Africa are increasing due to the HIV epidemic and will account for the remaining 20.5{\%} of the forecast increase in new cases. In WHO's South-East Asian Region and in Central and South America the age-specific incidence rates are expected to fall during 1990-2000, but at a slower rate than in previous years because of the expected increase in HIV seroprevalence.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Pharmaceutical treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) reduces the risk of progression to active tuberculosis (TB); however, poor adherence tempers the protective effect. We aimed to estimate the health burden of non-adherence, the maximum allowable cost of hypothetical new adherence interventions to be cost-effective and the potential value of existing adherence interventions for patients with low-risk LTBI in Canada. DESIGN: A microsimulation model of LTBI progression over 25 years. SETTING: General practice in Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Individuals with LTBI who are initiating drug therapy. INTERVENTIONS: A hypothetical intervention with a range of effectiveness was evaluated. Existing drug adherence interventions including peer support, two-way text messaging support, enhanced adherence counselling and adherence incentives were also evaluated. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: Simulation outcomes included healthcare costs, TB incidence, TB deaths and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Base case results were interpreted against a willingness-to-pay threshold of {\$}C50 000/QALY. RESULTS: Compared with current adherence levels, full adherence to LTBI drug therapy could reduce new TB cases from 90.3 cases per 100 000 person-years to 35.9 cases per 100 000 person-years and reduce TB-related deaths from 7.9 deaths per 100 000 person-years to 3.1 deaths per 100 000 person-years. An intervention that increases relative adherence by 40{\%} would bring the population near full adherence to drug therapy and could have a maximum allowable annual cost of approximately {\$}C450 per person to be cost-effective. Based on estimates of effect sizes and costs of existing adherence interventions, we found that they yielded between 900 and 2400 additional QALYs per million people, reduced TB deaths by 5{\%}-25{\%} and were likely to be cost-effective over 25 years. CONCLUSION: Full adherence could reduce the number of future TB cases by nearly 60{\%}, offsetting TB-related costs and health burden. Several existing interventions are could be cost-effective to help achieve this goal.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although the emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance have been well studied for endemic infections, comparably little is understood for epidemic infections such as influenza. The availability of antimicrobial treatments for epidemic diseases raises the urgent question of how to deploy treatments to achieve maximum benefit despite resistance evolution. Recent simulation studies have shown that the number of cases prevented by antimicrobials can be maximized by delaying the use of treatments during an epidemic. Those studies focus on indirect effects of antimicrobial use: preventing disease among untreated individuals. Here, we identify and examine direct effects of antimicrobial use: the number of successfully treated cases.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODOLOGY: We develop mathematical models to study how the schedule of antiviral use influences the success or failure of subsequent use due to the spread of resistant strains.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Direct effects are maximized by postponing drug use, even with unlimited stockpiles of drugs. This occurs because the early use of antimicrobials disproportionately drives emergence and spread of antibiotic resistance, leading to subsequent treatment failure. However, for antimicrobials with low effect on transmission, the relative benefit of delaying antimicrobial deployment is greatly reduced and can only be reaped if the trajectory of the epidemic can be accurately estimated early.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Health planners face uncertainties during epidemics, including the possibility of early containment. Hence, despite the optimal deployment time near the epidemic peak, it will often be preferable to initiate widespread antimicrobial use as early as possible, particularly if the drug is ineffective in reducing transmission.},

Despite years of study, the impact of badgers on BTB incidence in cattle is poorly understood. Using a two-host transmission model of BTB in cattle and badgers, we find that published data and parameter estimates are most consistent with a system at the threshold of control. The most consistent explanation for data obtained from cattle and badger populations includes within-host reproduction numbers close to 1 and between-host reproduction numbers of approximately 0.05. In terms of controlling infection in cattle, reducing cattle-to-cattle transmission is essential. In some regions, even large reductions in badger prevalence can have a modest impact on cattle infection and a multi-stranded approach is necessary that also targets badger-to-cattle transmission directly. The new perspective highlighted by this two-host approach provides insight into the control of BTB in Great Britain.},

abstract = {Decisions on how to mitigate an evolving pandemic are technically challenging. We present a real-time assessment of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of alternative influenza A/H1N1v vaccination strategies. A transmission dynamic model was fitted to the estimated number of cases in real-time, and used to generate plausible autumn scenarios under different vaccination options. The proportion of these cases by age and risk group leading to primary care consultations, National Pandemic Flu Service consultations, emergency attendances, hospitalisations, intensive care and death was then estimated using existing data from the pandemic. The real-time model suggests that the epidemic will peak in early November, with the peak height being similar in magnitude to the summer wave. Vaccination of the high-risk groups is estimated to prevent about 45 deaths (80{\%} credibility interval 26-67), and save around 2900 QALYs (80{\%} credibility interval 1600-4500). Such a programme is very likely to be cost-effective if the cost of vaccine purchase itself is treated as a sunk cost. Extending vaccination to low-risk individuals is expected to result in more modest gains in deaths and QALYs averted. Extending vaccination to school-age children would be the most cost-effective extension. The early availability of vaccines is crucial in determining the impact of such extensions. There have been a considerable number of cases of H1N1v in England, and so the benefits of vaccination to mitigate the ongoing autumn wave are limited. However, certain groups appear to be at significantly higher risk of complications and deaths, and so it appears both effective and cost-effective to vaccinate them. The United Kingdom was the first country to have a major epidemic in Europe. In countries where the epidemic is not so far advanced vaccination of children may be cost-effective. Similar, detailed, real-time modelling and economic studies could help to clarify the situation. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The use of multi-scale mathematical and computational models to study complex biological processes is becoming increasingly productive. Multi-scale models span a range of spatial and/or temporal scales and can encompass multi-compartment (e.g., multi-organ) models. Modeling advances are enabling virtual experiments to explore and answer questions that are problematic to address in the wet-lab. Wet-lab experimental technologies now allow scientists to observe, measure, record, and analyze experiments focusing on different system aspects at a variety of biological scales. We need the technical ability to mirror that same flexibility in virtual experiments using multi-scale models. Here we present a new approach, tuneable resolution, which can begin providing that flexibility. Tuneable resolution involves fine- or coarse-graining existing multi-scale models at the user's discretion, allowing adjustment of the level of resolution specific to a question, an experiment, or a scale of interest. Tuneable resolution expands options for revising and validating mechanistic multi-scale models, can extend the longevity of multi-scale models, and may increase computational efficiency. The tuneable resolution approach can be applied to many model types, including differential equation, agent-based, and hybrid models. We demonstrate our tuneable resolution ideas with examples relevant to infectious disease modeling, illustrating key principles at work.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of the new QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-G) [Cellestis; Carnegie, VIC, Australia] assay for screening and treating of persons who have had close contact with tuberculosis (TB) patients and are suspected of having latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) [hereafter called close-contacts] in Germany. METHODS: The health and economic outcomes of isoniazid treatment of 20-year-old close-contacts were compared in a Markov model over a period of 20 years, using two different cutoff values for the tuberculin skin test (TST), the QFT-G assay alone, or the QFT-G assay as a confirmatory test for the TST results. RESULTS: QFT-G assay-based treatment led to cost savings of {\$}542.9 and 3.8 life-days gained per LTBI case. TST-based treatment at a 10-mm induration size cutoff gained {\$}177.4 and 2.0 life-days gained per test-positive contact. When the cutoff induration size for the TST was reduced to 5 mm, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio fell below the willingness-to-pay threshold ({\$}30,170 per life-years gained) but resulted in unnecessary treatment of 77{\%} of contacts owing to false-positive TST results. Combination with the 5-mm induration size TST cutoff value compared to the results of the QFT-G assay alone reduced the total costs per 1,000 contacts by 1.8{\%} to {\$}222,869. The number treated to prevent 1 TB case was 22 for the two QFT-G assay-based procedures, 40 for the TST at a cutoff induration size of 10 mm, and 96 for the TST at a cutoff induration size of 5 mm. When the sensitivity rates of the TST and the QFT-G assay were compounded, the QFT-G assay strategy alone was slightly less costly (0.6{\%}) than the two-step approach. CONCLUSIONS: Using the QFT-G assay, but especially combining the QFT-G assay following the TST screening of close-contacts at a cutoff induration size of 5 mm before LTBI treatment is highly cost-effective in reducing the disease burden of TB.},

abstract = {Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Gu??rin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis. In this work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis. The results of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether the protective efficacy of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) against tuberculosis decreases with time since vaccination. DESIGN: A quantitative review of all 10 randomized trials of BCG against tuberculosis in purified protein derivative (PPD)-negative individuals, that presented data for discrete periods. For each trial, we derived log rate ratios for the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. We also compared efficacy in the first two years, and the first 10 years, to that in the rest of the trial. RESULTS: There was considerable heterogeneity between trials in the annual change in the efficacy of BCG. In seven efficacy decreased overtime, while in three it increased. Average annual change in efficacy was not related to overall efficacy. Efficacy also varied between trials in the first two years after vaccination, at more than two years after vaccination and in the first ten years after vaccination. However the variation in efficacy between trials more than 10 years after vaccination was not statistically significant (P = 0.26). We therefore calculated that the average efficacy more than 10 years after vaccination was 14{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval -9{\%} to 32{\%}). CONCLUSION: BCG protection can wane with time since vaccination. There is no good evidence that BCG provides protection more than 10 years after vaccination.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is a serious public health issue in developing countries. Early prediction of TB epidemic is very important for its control and intervention. We aimed to develop an appropriate model for predicting TB epidemics and analyze its seasonality in China. METHODS: Data of monthly TB incidence cases from January 2005 to December 2011 were obtained from the Ministry of Health, China. A seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and a hybrid model which combined the SARIMA model and a generalized regression neural network model were used to fit the data from 2005 to 2010. Simulation performance parameters of mean square error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) were used to compare the goodness-of-fit between these two models. Data from 2011 TB incidence data was used to validate the chosen model. RESULTS: Although both two models could reasonably forecast the incidence of TB, the hybrid model demonstrated better goodness-of-fit than the SARIMA model. For the hybrid model, the MSE, MAE and MAPE were 38969150, 3406.593 and 0.030, respectively. For the SARIMA model, the corresponding figures were 161835310, 8781.971 and 0.076, respectively. The seasonal trend of TB incidence is predicted to have lower monthly incidence in January and February and higher incidence from March to June. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid model showed better TB incidence forecasting than the SARIMA model. There is an obvious seasonal trend of TB incidence in China that differed from other countries.},

@article{Feng2017,
abstract = {Among the several means by which heterogeneity can be modeled, Levins' (1969) meta-population approach preserves the most analytical tractability, a virtue to the extent that generality is desirable. When model populations are stratified, contacts among their respective sub-populations must be described. Using a simple meta-population model, Feng et al. (2015) showed that mixing among sub-populations, as well as heterogeneity in characteristics affecting sub-population reproduction numbers, must be considered when evaluating public health interventions to prevent or control infectious disease outbreaks. They employed the convex combination of preferential within- and proportional among-group contacts first described by Nold (1980) and subsequently generalized by Jacquez et al. (1988). As the utility of meta-population modeling depends on more realistic mixing functions, the authors added preferential contacts between parents and children and among co-workers (Glasser et al., 2012). Here they further generalize this function by including preferential contacts between grandparents and grandchildren, but omit workplace contacts. They also describe a general multi-level mixing scheme, provide three two-level examples, and apply two of them. In their first application, the authors describe age- and gender-specific patterns in face-to-face conversations (Mossong et al., 2008), proxies for contacts by which respiratory pathogens might be transmitted, that are consistent with everyday experience. This suggests that meta-population models with inter-generational mixing could be employed to evaluate prolonged school-closures, a proposed pandemic mitigation measure that could expose grandparents, and other elderly surrogate caregivers for working parents, to infectious children. In their second application, the authors use a meta-population SEIR model stratified by 7 age groups and 50 states plus the District of Columbia, to compare actual with optimal vaccination during the 2009-2010 influenza pandemic in the United States. They also show that vaccination efforts could have been adjusted month-to-month during the fall of 2009 to ensure maximum impact. Such applications inspire confidence in the reliability of meta-population modeling in support of public health policymaking.},

@article{Vynnycky1998,
abstract = {The net and basic reproduction numbers are among the most widely-applied concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. A net reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases resulting from each case in a given population) of above 1 is conventionally associated with an increase in incidence; the basic reproduction number (defined analogously for a 'totally susceptible' population) provides a standard measure of the 'transmission potential' of an infection. Using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1900, we demonstrate that these measures are difficult to apply if disease can follow reinfection, and that they lose their conventional interpretations if important epidemiological parameters, such as the rate of contact between individuals, change over the time interval between successive cases in a chain of transmission (the serial interval). The net reproduction number for tuberculosis in England and Wales appears to have been approximately 1 from 1900 until 1950, despite concurrent declines in morbidity and mortality rates, and it declined rapidly in the second half of this century. The basic reproduction number declined from about 3 in 1900, reached 2 by 1950, and first fell below 1 in about 1960. Reductions in effective contact between individuals over this period, measured in terms of the average number of individuals to whom each case could transmit the infection, meant that the conventional basic reproduction number measure (which does not consider subsequent changes in epidemiological parameters) for a given year failed to reflect the 'actual transmission potential' of the infection. This latter property is better described by a variant of the conventional measure which takes secular trends in contact into account. These results are relevant for the interpretation of trends in any infectious disease for which epidemiological parameters change over time periods comparable to the infectious period, incubation period or serial interval.},

METHODS: The Birth Register data were used to generate a list of babies born in the catchment area of Basildon and Thurrock NHS Trust between 1 January 2001 and 31 December 2001 who were eligible for BCG immunization. The Community Child Health computer was used to generate information about their BCG immunization status. RESULTS: 201 children were included in the study. One hundred and seventy-one children had received BCG immunization in the neonatal period, out of which 169 had received it before discharge from the hospital. Two children were immunized in the community in the neonatal period. Thus, 85{\%} of the newborns eligible for BCG immunization received their vaccination in the neonatal period. CONCLUSIONS: The current "Neonatal BCG Immunisation Policy" is effective, and there is a high uptake of the vaccine in the neonatal period within the hospital itself. Newborn infants who do not receive BCG immunization in hospital rarely get immunized in the community.},

abstract = {When an individual is exposed to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) three outcomes are possible: bacterial clearance, active disease, or latent infection. It is generally believed that most individuals exposed to Mtb become latently infected and carry the mycobacteria for life. How Mtb is maintained during this latent infection remains largely unknown. During an Mtb infection in mice, there is a phase of rapid increase in bacterial numbers in the murine lungs within the first 3 weeks, and then bacterial numbers either stabilize or increase slowly over the period of many months. It has been debated whether the relatively constant numbers of bacteria in the chronic infection result from latent (dormant, quiescent), non-replicating bacteria, or whether the observed Mtb cell numbers are due to balance between rapid replication and death. A recent study of mice, infected with a Mtb strain carrying an unstable plasmid, showed that during the chronic phase, Mtb was replicating at significant rates. Using experimental data from this study and mathematical modeling we investigated the limits of the rates of bacterial replication, death, and quiescence during Mtb infection of mice. First, we found that to explain the data the rates of bacterial replication and death could not be constant and had to decrease with time since infection unless there were large changes in plasmid segregation probability over time. While a decrease in the rate of Mtb replication with time since infection was expected due to depletion of host's resources, a decrease in the Mtb death rate was counterintuitive since Mtb-specific immune response, appearing in the lungs 3-4 weeks after infection, should increase removal of bacteria. Interestingly, we found no significant correlation between estimated rates of Mtb replication and death suggesting the decline in these rates was driven by independent mechanisms. Second, we found that the data could not be explained by assuming that bacteria do not die, suggesting that some removal of bacteria from lungs of these mice had to occur even though the total bacterial counts in these mice always increased over time. Third and finally, we showed that to explain the data the majority of bacterial cells (at least {\~{}}60{\%}) must be replicating in the chronic phase of infection further challenging widespread belief of nonreplicating Mtb in latency. Our predictions were robust to some changes in the structure of the model, for example, when the loss of plasmid-bearing cells was mainly due to high fitness cost of the plasmid. Further studies should determine if more mechanistic models for Mtb dynamics are also able to accurately explain these data.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV). The study of the joint dynamics of HBV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. We formulate and analyze a deterministic mathematical model which incorporates of the co-dynamics of hepatitis B and tuberculosis. Two sub-models, namely: HBV-only and TB-only sub-models are considered first of all. Unlike the HBV-only sub-model, which has a globally-asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction number is less than unity, the TB-only sub-model undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a stable endemic equilibrium, for a certain range of the associated reproduction number less than unity. Thus, for TB, the classical requirement of having the associated reproduction number to be less than unity, although necessary, is not sufficient for its elimination. It is also shown, that the full HBV-TB co-infection model undergoes a backward bifurcation phenomenon. Through simulations, we mainly find that i) the two diseases will co-exist whenever their partial reproductive numbers exceed unity; (ii) the increased progression rate due to exogenous reinfection from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and (iii) the increased progression rates from acute stage to chronic stage of HBV infection have increased the prevalence levels of HBV and TB prevalences.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparing of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called 'loo' and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

abstract = {A powerful and flexible method for fitting dynamic models to missing and censored data is to use the Bayesian paradigm via data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC). This samples from the joint posterior for the parameters and missing data, but requires high memory overheads for large-scale systems. In addition, designing efficient proposal distributions for the missing data is typically challenging. Pseudo-marginal methods instead integrate across the missing data using a Monte Carlo estimate for the likelihood, generated from multiple independent simulations from the model. These techniques can avoid the high memory requirements of DA-MCMC, and under certain conditions produce the exact marginal posterior distribution for parameters. A novel method is presented for implementing importance sampling for dynamic epidemic models, by conditioning the simulations on sets of validity criteria (based on the model structure) as well as the observed data. The flexibility of these techniques is illustrated using both removal time and final size data from an outbreak of smallpox. It is shown that these approaches can circumvent the need for reversible-jump MCMC, and can allow inference in situations where DA-MCMC is impossible due to computationally infeasible likelihoods. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: South Africa has one of the highest per capita rates of tuberculosis (TB) incidence in the world. In 2012, the South African government produced a National Strategic Plan (NSP) to control the spread of TB with the ambitious aim of zero new TB infections and deaths by 2032, and a halving of the 2012 rates by 2016. METHODS: We used a transmission model to investigate whether the NSP targets could be reached if immediate scale up of control methods had happened in 2014. We explored the potential impact of four intervention portfolios; 1) "NSP" represents the NSP strategy, 2) "WHO" investigates increasing antiretroviral therapy eligibility, 3) "Novel Strategies" considers new isoniazid preventive therapy strategies and HIV "Universal Test and Treat" and 4) "Optimised" contains the most effective interventions. FINDINGS: We find that even with this scale-up, the NSP targets are unlikely to be achieved. The portfolio that achieved the greatest impact was "Optimised", followed closely by "NSP". The "WHO" and "Novel Strategies" had little impact on TB incidence by 2050. Of the individual interventions explored, the most effective were active case finding and reductions in pre-treatment loss to follow up which would have a large impact on TB burden. CONCLUSION: Use of existing control strategies has the potential to have a large impact on TB disease burden in South Africa. However, our results suggest that the South African TB targets are unlikely to be reached without new technologies. Despite this, TB incidence could be dramatically reduced by finding and starting more TB cases on treatment.},

The statistical data of tuberculosis (TB) cases show seasonal fluctuations in many countries. Then, the extension of our TB model by incorporating seasonality is developed and the basic reproduction ratio is defined.

abstract = {Increased rates of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation have been reported in humans treated with TNF-alpha (TNF)-neutralizing drugs, and higher rates are observed with anti-TNF Abs (e.g., infliximab) as compared with TNF receptor fusion protein (etanercept). Mechanisms driving differential reactivation rates and differences in drug action are not known. We use a computational model of a TB granuloma formation that includes TNF/TNF receptor dynamics to elucidate these mechanisms. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, drug binding to membrane-bound TNF critically impairs granuloma function. Second, a higher risk of reactivation induced from Ab-type treatments is primarily due to differences in TNF/drug binding kinetics and permeability. Apoptotic and cytolytic activities of Abs and pharmacokinetic fluctuations in blood concentration of drug are not essential to inducing TB reactivation. Third, we predict specific host factors that, if augmented, would improve granuloma function during anti-TNF therapy. Our findings have implications for the development of safer anti-TNF drugs to treat inflammatory diseases.},

abstract = {Trials of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for people living with HIV in southern Africa have shown high rates of tuberculosis disease immediately after cessation of therapy. This could be due to the lack of cure following preventive therapy or reinfection with rapid progression to disease. Using a model fitted to trial data, we estimate the degree to which preventive therapies cure latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection in HIV-infected individuals in high-tuberculosis-burden settings. We identified randomized controlled trials that compared IPT to placebo or alternative regimen in HIV-positive, tuberculin skin test positive individuals. A mathematical model describing tuberculosis transmission in a closed cohort of HIV-positive, M. tuberculosis infected, antiretroviral therapy naive individuals following completion of preventive therapy (or placebo) was fitted to posttherapy tuberculosis rates to estimate the annual risk of M. tuberculosis reinfection and the proportion of individuals whose latent infection was cured after therapy. Three trials met our inclusion criteria. Estimated annual risks of reinfection ranged between 3.7 and 4.9{\%}. Our results suggest 6 mo of isoniazid cured in a small proportion [estimated proportion cured = 0{\%} (interquartile range 0-30.9{\%})]. The proportion cured for 3-mo regimens containing rifampicin or rifapentine was 19-100{\%}. IPT alone does not cure existing infections in the majority of HIV-infected individuals. In high-incidence settings, continuous IPT should be integrated with HIV care. Where the risk of reinfection is lower, preventive therapy with more curative drugs should be preferred for HIV-positive individuals to achieve durable patient benefit.},

abstract = {Since the early 1960s notification rates for tuberculosis in England and Wales for the whole population have been influenced by high rates in certain ethnic groups. Using data based on country of birth from the British (Thoracic and) Tuberculosis Association surveys of 1965 and 1971, and based on ethnic origin from the Medical Research Council surveys in 1978/79 and 1983, rates for the white ethnic group have been estimated at those four times, and compared with the published rates for the whole population in 1953, when only a very small proportion was of non-white ethnic origin. Between 1953 and 1983 the notification rate for the white ethnic group fell from 122.2 to 11.3 per 100,000 for males, an annual decline of 7.7{\%}, the corresponding rates for females being 90.1 and 5.8, an annual decline of 8.8{\%}. The greatest annual declines occurred between 1953 and 1965, 9.4{\%} for males and 11.2{\%} for females. The annual declines in the most recent period, 1978/79 to 1983, were 6.9{\%} for males and 7.3{\%} for females. In both sexes the decline was greatest in the 15-24 year age group and least in the oldest age group, and this has led to a change in the age pattern of annual notification rates. The highest rates in both sexes occurred in young adults in 1953 but in the oldest age groups in 1983. There is however no evidence of any cohort experiencing an increase in notification rate with increasing age.},

abstract = {Approximately 72{\%} of tuberculosis (TB) cases in England occur among non-UK born individuals, mostly as a result of reactivation of latent TB infection (LTBI). Programmatic LTBI screening is a key intervention of the TB strategy for England. This article reviews the results of a long-standing LTBI screening initiative in England.A retrospective cohort was created through probabilistic linkage between LTBI screening data and national TB case notifications. Screened persons were followed until they died, became a case, emigrated or until cohort-end. TB incidence rates and rate ratios (IRR) were calculated.97 out of 1820 individuals screened for LTBI were reported to have active TB. Crude incidence rates among LTBI-positive, treatment-na{\"{i}}ve individuals were 4.1 and 2.3 per 100 person-years in the QuantiFERON and tuberculin skin test cohorts, respectively. Among the QuantiFERON cohort, Poisson regression showed that LTBI positivity (IRR 22.6, 95{\%} CI 6.8-74.6) and no chemoprophylaxis increased the probability of becoming a TB case (IRR 0.17, 95{\%} CI 0.05-0.6).We found high TB rates in LTBI-positive, treatment-na{\"{i}}ve individuals and a strong association between no treatment and becoming a TB case, demonstrating feasibility and effectiveness of LTBI screening and providing important policy lessons for LTBI screening in England and beyond.},

abstract = {SETTING: The expansion of culture has been proposed to aid tuberculosis (TB) control in developing countries. OBJECTIVES: To examine the cost and cost-effectiveness at the Zambian National TB Reference Laboratory of homemade and commercially produced Lowenstein-Jensen culture (HLJ and CLJ) as well as automated and manually read liquid culture (AMGIT and MMGIT). DESIGN: Costs were estimated from the provider's perspective and based on the average monthly throughput. Cost-effectiveness estimates were based on yield during the study period. RESULTS: All techniques show comparable costs per culture (between US{\$}28 and {\$}32). Costs per Mycobacterium tuberculosis specimen detected were respectively US{\$}197, {\$}202, {\$}312 and {\$}340 for MMGIT, AMGIT, CLJ and HLJ. When modelled for the maximum throughput, costs were above US{\$}95 per M. tuberculosis specimen detected for all techniques. When only performed among smear-negative specimens, costs per additionally identified M. tuberculosis would be US{\$}487 for MMGIT and higher for other methods. CONCLUSION: Based on cost-effectiveness grounds, liquid media compare well with conventional solid media, especially where yield of MGIT is substantially higher than that of LJ media. The results indicate high overall costs per culture; the expansion of culture to decentralised levels with lower throughputs may result in even higher costs.},

abstract = {Over 50{\%} of the global burden of tuberculosis occurs in South East Asia and the Western Pacific. Since 1950, notification rates in high-income countries in these settings have declined slowly and have remained over ten-fold greater than those in Western populations. The reasons for the slow decline are poorly understood. Using an age-structured model describing the incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease applied to notification data from Hong Kong, we illustrate that in Hong Kong, a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection among older individuals and a high risk of disease through reactivation (e.g. up to 17-fold greater than that estimated for infected males in the United Kingdom) may explain this slow decline. If this feature of the epidemiology of tuberculosis is widespread, the WHO directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy may have a smaller impact in Asia in the short term than has been implied by recent predictions, all of which have been based on disease risk estimates derived from Western Europe. As a result, it may be difficult to meet the targets for tuberculosis control, which have been prescribed by the UN Millennium Development Goals.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a major source of global mortality caused by infection, partly because of a tremendous ongoing burden of undiagnosed disease. Improved diagnostic technology may play an increasingly crucial part in global efforts to end tuberculosis, but the ability of diagnostic tests to curb tuberculosis transmission is dependent on multiple factors, including the time taken by a patient to seek health care, the patient's symptoms, and the patterns of transmission before diagnosis. Novel diagnostic assays for tuberculosis have conventionally been evaluated on the basis of characteristics such as sensitivity and specificity, using assumptions that probably overestimate the impact of diagnostic tests on transmission. We argue for a shift in focus to the evaluation of such tests' incremental value, defining outcomes that reflect each test's purpose (for example, transmissions averted) and comparing systems with the test against those without, in terms of those outcomes. Incremental value can also be measured in units of outcome per incremental unit of resource (for example, money or human capacity). Using a novel, simplified model of tuberculosis transmission that addresses some of the limitations of earlier tuberculosis diagnostic models, we demonstrate that the incremental value of any novel test depends not just on its accuracy, but also on elements such as patient behaviour, tuberculosis natural history and health systems. By integrating these factors into a single unified framework, we advance an approach to the evaluation of new diagnostic tests for tuberculosis that considers the incremental value at the population level and demonstrates how additional data could inform more-effective implementation of tuberculosis diagnostic tests under various conditions.},

abstract = {Background In September, 2015, the UK became the first country to introduce the multicomponent group B meningococcal (MenB) vaccine (4CMenB, Bexsero) into a publicly funded national immunisation programme. A reduced two-dose priming schedule was offered to infants at 2 months and 4 months, alongside an opportunistic catch-up for 3 month and 4 month olds. 4CMenB was predicted to protect against 73???88{\%} of MenB strains. We aimed to assess the effectiveness and impact of 4CMenB in vaccine-eligible infants in England. Methods Public Health England (PHE) undertakes enhanced surveillance of meningococcal disease through a combination of clinical, public health, and laboratory reporting. Laboratory-confirmed cases of meningococcal disease are followed up with PHE local health protection teams, general practitioners, and hospital clinicians to collect demographic data, vaccination history, clinical presentation, and outcome. For cases diagnosed between Sept 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016, vaccine effectiveness was assessed using the screening method. Impact was assessed by comparing numbers of cases of MenB in vaccine-eligible children to equivalent cohorts in the previous 4 years and to cases in vaccine-ineligible children. Findings Coverage of 4CMenB in infants eligible for routine vaccination was high, achieving 95??5{\%} for one dose and 88??6{\%} for two doses by 6 months of age. Two-dose vaccine effectiveness was 82??9{\%} (95{\%} CI 24??1???95??2) against all MenB cases, equivalent to a vaccine effectiveness of 94??2{\%} against the highest predicted MenB strain coverage of 88{\%}. Compared with the prevaccine period, there was a 50{\%} incidence rate ratio (IRR) reduction in MenB cases in the vaccine-eligible cohort (37 cases vs average 74 cases; IRR 0??50 [95{\%} CI 0??36???0??71]; p=0??0001), irrespective of the infants??? vaccination status or predicted MenB strain coverage. Similar reductions were observed even after adjustment for disease trends in vaccine-eligible and vaccine-ineligible children. Interpretation The two-dose 4CMenB priming schedule was highly effective in preventing MenB disease in infants. Cases in vaccine-eligible infants halved in the first 10 months of the programme. While ongoing national surveillance will continue to monitor the longer-term impact of the programme, these findings represent a step forward in the battle against meningococcal disease and will help reassure that the vaccine protects against this deadly infection.

abstract = {Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis is not recommended for all persons infected with tubercle bacilli. Because of the small but significant risk of isoniazid hepatotoxicity, chemoprophylaxis is reserved for only those at the highest risk of tuberculosis activation. To evaluate this policy, we performed a cost-effectiveness analysis of isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for two populations with positive tuberculin skin tests: recent tuberculin converters, who are at high risk for activation, and older tuberculin reactors, who have a low risk for activation and for whom chemoprophylaxis is not now recommended. The cost-effectiveness ratios found were stable, despite wide variations in model assumptions and probability estimates. For high-risk tuberculin reactors, chemoprophylaxis resulted in net medical care monetary savings, extended life expectancy, and fewer fatal illnesses. For low-risk tuberculin reactors, chemoprophylaxis resulted in positive, but small, health effects. Because the cost to gain these positive effects were also small, the resulting cost-effectiveness ratios were reasonable and in the realm of accepted prevention strategies: {\$}12,625 to gain one year of life and {\$}35,011 to avert one death. These findings suggest that the current policy is too restrictive and that many in the large population of low-risk tuberculin reactors should be considered for isoniazid chemoprophylaxis.},

abstract = {In this manuscript we apply stochastic modeling to investigate the risk of reactivation of latent mycobacterial infections in patients undergoing treatment with tumor necrosis factor inhibitors. First, we review the perspective proposed by one of the authors in a previous work and which consists in predicting the occurrence of reactivation of latent tuberculosis infection or newly acquired tuberculosis during treatment; this is based on variational procedures on a simple set of parameters (e.g. rate of reactivation of a latent infection). Then, we develop a full analytical study of this approach through a Markov chain analysis and we find an exact solution for the temporal evolution of the number of cases of tuberculosis infection (re)activation. The analytical solution is compared with Monte Carlo simulations and with experimental data, showing overall excellent agreement. The generality of this theoretical framework allows to investigate also the case of non-tuberculous mycobacteria infections; in particular, we show that reactivation in that context plays a minor role. This may suggest that, while the screening for tuberculous is necessary prior to initiating biologics, when considering non-tuberculous mycobacteria only a watchful monitoring during the treatment is recommended. The framework outlined in this paper is quite general and could be extremely promising in further researches on drug-related adverse events.},

New technology and novel approaches to case-finding, diagnosis, and treatment are causes for optimism but they need to be used cost-effectively. This in turn requires improved understanding of the epidemiology of TB and analysis of the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different interventions. We describe the contribution that mathematical modeling can make to understanding epidemiology and control of TB in different groups, guiding improved approaches to public health interventions. We emphasize that modeling is not a substitute for collecting data but rather is complementary to empirical research, helping determine what are the key questions to address to maximize the public-health impact of research, helping to plan studies, and making maximal use of available data, particularly from surveillance, and observational studies. We provide examples of how modeling and related empirical research inform policy and discuss how a combination of these approaches can be used to address current questions of key importance, including use of whole-genome sequencing, screening and treatment for latent infection, and combating drug resistance.},

abstract = {We discuss to what extent disease transmission models provide reliable predictions. The concept of prediction is delineated as it is understood by modellers, and illustrated by some classic and recent examples. A precondition for a model to provide valid predictions is that the assumptions underlying it correspond to the reality, but such correspondence is always limited—all models are simplifications of reality. A central tenet of the modelling enterprise is what we may call the 'robustness thesis': a model whose assumptions approximately correspond to reality will make predictions that are approximately valid. To examine which of the predictions made by a model are trustworthy, it is essential to examine the outcomes of different models. Thus, if a highly simplified model makes a prediction, and if the same or a very similar prediction is made by a more elaborate model that includes some mechanisms or details that the first model did not, then we gain some confidence that the prediction is robust. An important benefit derived from mathematical modelling activity is that it demands transparency and accuracy regarding our assumptions, thus enabling us to test our understanding of the disease epidemiology by comparing model results and observed patterns. Models can also assist in decision-making by making projections regarding important issues such as intervention-induced changes in the spread of disease.},

abstract = {A co-epidemic arises when the spread of one infectious disease stimulates the spread of another infectious disease. Recently, this has happened with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and tuberculosis (TB). We develop two variants of a coepidemic model of two diseases. We calculate the basic reproduction number (R(0)), the disease-free equilibrium, and the quasi-disease-free equilibria, which we de. ne as the existence of one disease along with the complete eradication of the other disease, and the co-infection equilibria for specific conditions. We determine stability criteria for the disease-free and quasi-disease-free equilibria. We present an illustrative numerical analysis of the HIV-TB co-epidemics in India that we use to explore the effects of hypothetical prevention and treatment scenarios. Our numerical analysis demonstrates that exclusively treating HIV or TB may reduce the targeted epidemic, but can subsequently exacerbate the other epidemic. Our analyses suggest that coordinated treatment efforts that include highly active antiretroviral therapy for HIV, latent TB prophylaxis, and active TB treatment may be necessary to slow the HIV-TB co-epidemic. However, treatment alone may not be sufficient to eradicate both diseases. Increased disease prevention efforts (for example, those that promote condom use) may also be needed to extinguish this co-epidemic. Our simple model of two synergistic infectious disease epidemics illustrates the importance of including the effects of each disease on the transmission and progression of the other disease.},

abstract = {SETTING: Patient non-compliance and/or spatial heterogeneity in drug concentration or effectiveness may contribute to the emergence of drug resistance during multiple-drug chemotherapy of tuberculosis. OBJECTIVE: Using mathematical models of mycobacterial population dynamics under antimicrobial treatment, to assess the effects of non-compliance, heterogeneity and other factors on the success of treatment. DESIGN: A mathematical model is used to generate predictions about the ascent of drug resistance in treated hosts with non-compliance and/or a 'protected compartment' of bacteria where only one drug is active; simulations of a more realistic version of this model take into account random mutation, and different assumptions about the size of, and growth rate of bacteria in, the protected compartment. RESULTS: The existence of a protected compartment can increase the likelihood of resistance to the single drug active in that compartment, but only if bacteria resistant to that drug can grow in the protected compartment or if the host is non-adherent to the treatment regimen. However, the protected compartment may also slow the ascent of bacteria resistant to drugs not active in it (e.g. isoniazid) by providing a reservoir of non-selected mycobacteria. The model predicts that relative rates of killing are more important than mutation rates in determining the order in which resistant mutants ascend. Model predictions, in combination with data about drug resistance patterns, suggest that non-compliance, but not heterogeneity, is an important cause of treatment failure. CONCLUSION: Patterns of acquired drug resistance may be used to infer processes of selection during treatment; mathematical models can aid in generating predictions about the relative impacts of treatment parameters in the evolution of resistance, and eventually in suggesting improved treatment protocols.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isoniazid chemoprophylaxis effectively prevents the development of active infectious tuberculosis. Current guidelines recommend withholding this prophylaxis for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age because of the risk for fatal isoniazid-induced hepatitis. However, recent studies have shown that monitoring for hepatotoxicity can significantly reduce the risk for isoniazid-related death. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of monitored isoniazid prophylaxis for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age. DESIGN: A Markov model was used to compare the health and economic outcomes of prescribing or withholding a course of prophylaxis for low-risk reactors 35, 50, or 70 years of age. Subsequent analyses evaluated costs and benefits when the effect of transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis to contacts was included. MEASUREMENTS: Probability of survival at 1 year, number needed to treat, life expectancy, and cost per year of life gained for individual persons and total population. RESULTS: Isoniazid prophylaxis increased the probability of survival at 1 year and for all subsequent years. For 35-year old, 50-year-old, and 70-year-old tuberculin reactors, life expectancy increased by 4.9 days, 4.7 days, and 3.1 days, respectively, and costs per person decreased by {\$}101, {\$}69, and {\$}11, respectively. When the effect of secondary transmission to contacts was included, the gains in life expectancy per person receiving prophylaxis were 10.0 days for 35-year-old reactors, 9.0 days for 50-year-old reactors, and 6.0 days for 70-year-old reactors. Costs per person for these cohorts decreased by {\$}259, {\$}203, and {\$}100, respectively. The magnitude of the benefit of isoniazid prophylaxis is moderately sensitive to the effect of isoniazid on quality of life. The hypothetical provision of isoniazid prophylaxis for all low-risk reactors older than 35 years of age in the U.S. population could prevent 35,176 deaths and save {\$}2.11 billion. CONCLUSIONS: Monitored isoniazid prophylaxis reduces mortality rates and health care costs for low-risk tuberculin reactors older than 35 years of age, although reductions for individual patients are small. For the U.S. population, however, the potential health benefits and economic savings resulting from wider use of monitored isoniazid prophylaxis are substantial. We should consider expanding current recommendations to include prophylaxis for tuberculin reactors of all ages with no contraindications.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), induces formation of granulomas, structures in which immune cells and bacteria colocalize. Macrophages are among the most abundant cell types in granulomas and have been shown to serve as both critical bactericidal cells and targets for M. tuberculosis infection and proliferation throughout the course of infection. Very little is known about how these processes are regulated, what controls macrophage microenvironment-specific polarization and plasticity, or why some granulomas control bacteria and others permit bacterial dissemination. We take a computational-biology approach to investigate mechanisms that drive macrophage polarization, function, and bacterial control in granulomas. We define a "macrophage polarization ratio" as a metric to understand how cytokine signaling translates into polarization of single macrophages in a granuloma, which in turn modulates cellular functions, including antimicrobial activity and cytokine production. Ultimately, we extend this macrophage ratio to the tissue scale and define a "granuloma polarization ratio" describing mean polarization measures for entire granulomas. Here we coupled experimental data from nonhuman primate TB granulomas to our computational model, and we predict two novel and testable hypotheses regarding macrophage profiles in TB outcomes. First, the temporal dynamics of granuloma polarization ratios are predictive of granuloma outcome. Second, stable necrotic granulomas with low CFU counts and limited inflammation are characterized by short NF-kappaB signal activation intervals. These results suggest that the dynamics of NF-kappaB signaling is a viable therapeutic target to promote M1 polarization early during infection and to improve outcome.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Undiagnosed and misdiagnosed tuberculosis (TB) drives the epidemic in India. Serological (antibody detection) TB tests are not recommended by any agency, but widely used in many countries, including the Indian private sector. The cost and impact of using serology compared with other diagnostic techniques is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: Taking a patient cohort conservatively equal to the annual number of serological tests done in India (1.5 million adults suspected of having active TB), we used decision analysis to estimate costs and effectiveness of sputum smear microscopy (US{\$}3.62 for two smears), microscopy plus automated liquid culture (mycobacterium growth indicator tube [MGIT], US{\$}20/test), and serological testing (anda-tb ELISA, US{\$}20/test). Data on test accuracy and costs were obtained from published literature. We adopted the perspective of the Indian TB control sector and an analysis frame of 1 year. Our primary outcome was the incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted. We performed one-way sensitivity analysis on all model parameters, with multiway sensitivity analysis on variables to which the model was most sensitive. If used instead of sputum microscopy, serology generated an estimated 14,000 more TB diagnoses, but also 121,000 more false-positive diagnoses, 102,000 fewer DALYs averted, and 32,000 more secondary TB cases than microscopy, at approximately four times the incremental cost (US{\$}47.5 million versus US{\$}11.9 million). When added to high-quality sputum smears, MGIT culture was estimated to avert 130,000 incremental DALYs at an incremental cost of US{\$}213 per DALY averted. Serology was dominated by (i.e., more costly and less effective than) MGIT culture and remained less economically favorable than sputum smear or TB culture in one-way and multiway sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In India, sputum smear microscopy remains the most cost-effective diagnostic test available for active TB; efforts to increase access to quality-assured microscopy should take priority. In areas where high-quality microscopy exists and resources are sufficient, MGIT culture is more cost-effective than serology as an additional diagnostic test for TB. These data informed a recently published World Health Organization policy statement against serological tests.},

abstract = {A population model for the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) which incorporates a preventive vaccine and an effective therapeutic treatment is analysed qualitatively. The existence and uniqueness of the associated endemic equilibrium are discussed. By constructing a Lyapunov function, the global stability of the disease-free equilibrium of the model is established. The stability analysis of the diseasefree equilibrium reveals that the disease dynamics depends on a threshold quantity called the basic reproduction number (R0) such that the disease will be eradicated from the community if R0 {\textless} 1 and it persists if R0 {\textgreater} 1. The model is adapted and used to study the case where no preventive vaccine is administered. In addition to establishing the global stability of the vaccination-free model, the optimal treatment rate needed for disease eradication is determined. The vaccination-free model is then extended to monitor the effect of exogenous re-infection in the transmission dynamics of TB. Our analysis shows that the vaccination-free model with exogenous re-infection may undergo the phenomenon of bistability where a stable endemic equilibrium can co-exist with the stable disease-free equilibrium when R0 {\textless} 1. This shows that, unlike in the case without exogenous re-infection, reducing R0 to values less than unity may fail to eradicate the disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: WHO advocates the use of directly observed treatment with a short-course drug regimen as part of the DOTS strategy, but the potential effect of this strategy worldwide has not been investigated. METHODS: We developed an age-structured mathematical model to explore the characteristics of tuberculosis control under DOTS, and to forecast the effect of improved case finding and cure on tuberculosis epidemics for each of the six WHO regions. FINDINGS: In countries where the incidence of tuberculosis is stable and HIV-1 absent, a control programme that reaches the WHO targets of 70{\%} case detection and 85{\%} cure would reduce the incidence rate by 11{\%} (range 8-12) per year and the death rate by 12{\%} (9-13) per year. If tuberculosis has been in decline for some years, the same case detection and cure rates would have a smaller effect on incidence. DOTS saves a greater proportion of deaths than cases, and this difference is bigger in the presence of HIV-1. HIV-1 epidemics cause an increase in tuberculosis incidence, but do not substantially reduce the preventable proportion of cases and deaths. Without greater effort to control tuberculosis, the annual incidence of the disease is expected to increase by 41{\%} (21-61) between 1998 and 2020 (from 7.4 million to 10.6 million cases per year). Achievement of WHO targets by 2010 would prevent 23{\%} (15-30) or 48 million cases by 2020. INTERPRETATION: The potential effect of chemotherapy (delivered as DOTS) on tuberculosis is greater in many developing countries now than it was in developed countries 50 years ago. To exploit this potential, case detection and cure rates urgently need to be improved in the main endemic areas.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Newborns in a hospital nursery were exposed to a mother whose sputum was direct-smear negative for acid-fast bacilli but culture positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Given the low risk for exposure, the high susceptibility of infants to M. tuberculosis infection, and the possibility of hepatotoxicity due to isoniazid therapy, a decision analysis model was used to determine whether administration of isoniazid prophylaxis against tuberculosis is preferable to no administration of prophylaxis. DESIGN: A decision analysis tree was constructed with software, using probabilities from the literature and costs from local health facilities. The expected values for each strategy were obtained, and sensitivity analyses were performed. RESULTS: For the strategy in which prophylaxis was administered under direct observation (DO), the probability for survival was 0.999980. For the strategy in which no prophylaxis was administered, the probability of survival was 0.999950, which corresponds to 3 more deaths per 100,000 patients than with the DO prophylaxis strategy. The incremental cost-effectiveness of the DO prophylaxis strategy was 21,710,000 US dollars per death prevented. Sensitivity analysis for survival showed that the DO prophylaxis strategy was preferable to the strategy in which no prophylaxis is given if the probability of infection was {\textgreater}0.0002, the probability of tuberculous disease in an infected infant who did not receive prophylaxis was greater than 0.12, the probability of dying from tuberculosis was greater than 0.025, the probability of hepatotoxicity was less than 0.004, and the probability of dying from hepatotoxicity was less than 0.04. For the strategy in which prophylaxis was administered under non-DO conditions (ie, by parents), the incremental cost-effectiveness was 929,500 US dollars per death prevented, which is approximately 5{\%} of the incremental cost-effectiveness of the DO prophylaxis strategy. CONCLUSION: This model provides a structure for determining the preferable prophylaxis strategies for different risks of exposure to tuberculosis in a nursery.

abstract = {The prevalence of tuberculous infection in a population is generally estimated from calculating the proportion of tested individuals who react with at least 10 mm of induration to 5 TU of PPD-S tuberculin. Reactions due to infection with atypical mycobacteria, however, may cause the prevalence to be overestimated. This paper is concerned with an alternative method of estimating the prevalence of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The method utilizes population distributions of reaction size by dividing study populations into two groups--individuals with and without known exposure to tuberculosis. The mathematical model developed here removes the effect of atypical infections and provides a truer picture of tuberculous infection. Data from a Navy recruit population demonstrate the use of the model with the result that among recruits with no known exposure to tuberculosis, the estimated prevalence is reduced by about one-half. Among recuits with known exposure to tuberculosis, there is essentially no difference between the two methods. Important advantages in using this method are that probabilities of true infection by induration size are generated, and that itis less sensitive to variations caused by differences in reading techniques and in tuberculin potencies. Furthermore, it is applicable to other diseases if the underlying assumptions are met.},

abstract = {Background: Current approaches are unlikely to achieve the aggressive global tuberculosis (TB) control targets set for 2035 and beyond. Active case finding (ACF) may be an important tool for augmenting existing strategies, but the cost-effectiveness of ACF remains uncertain. Program evaluators can often measure the cost of ACF per TB case detected, but how this accessible measure translates into traditional metrics of cost-effectiveness, such as the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY), remains unclear. Methods: We constructed dynamic models of TB in India, China, and South Africa to explore the medium-term impact and cost-effectiveness of generic ACF activities, conceptualized separately as discrete (2-year) campaigns and as continuous activities integrated into ongoing TB control programs. Our primary outcome was the cost per DALY, measured in relationship to the cost per TB case actively detected and started on treatment. Results: Discrete campaigns costing up to {\$}1,200 (95{\%} uncertainty range [UR] 850–2,043) per case actively detected and started on treatment in India, {\$}3,800 (95{\%} UR 2,706–6,392) in China, and {\$}9,400 (95{\%} UR 6,957–13,221) in South Africa were all highly cost-effective (cost per DALY averted less than per capita gross domestic product). Prolonged integration was even more effective and cost-effective. Short-term assessments of ACF dramatically underestimated potential longer term gains; for example, an assessment of an ACF program at 2 years might find a non-significant 11{\%} reduction in prevalence, but a 10-year evaluation of that same intervention would show a 33{\%} reduction. Conclusions: ACF can be a powerful and highly cost-effective tool in the fight against TB. Given that short-term assessments may dramatically underestimate medium-term effectiveness, current willingness to pay may be too low. ACF should receive strong consideration as a basic tool for TB control in most high-burden settings, even when it may cost over {\$}1,000 to detect and initiate treatment for each extra case of active TB.},

abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.

abstract = {Multivariable logistic regression is an important method to evaluate risk factors and prognosis in solid organ transplant literature. We aimed to assess the quality of this method in six major transplantation journals. Eleven analytical criteria and four documentation criteria were analyzed for each selected article that used logistic regression. A total of 106 studies (6{\%}) out of 1,701 original articles used logistic regression analyses from January 1, 2005 to January 1, 2006. The analytical criteria and their respective reporting percentage among the six journals were: Linearity (25{\%}); Beta coefficient (48{\%}); Interaction tests (19{\%}); Main estimates (98{\%}); Ovefitting prevention (84{\%}); Goodness-of-fit (3.8{\%}); Multicolinearity (4.7{\%}); Internal validation (3.8{\%}); External validation (8.5{\%}). The documentation criteria were reported as follows: Selection of independent variables (73{\%}); Coding of variables (9{\%}); Fitting procedures (49{\%}); Statistical program (65{\%}). No significant differences were found among different journals or between general versus subspecialty journals with respect to reporting quality. We found that the report of logistic regression is unsatisfactory in transplantation journals. Because our findings may have major consequences for the care of transplant patients and for the design of transplant clinical trials, we recommend a practical solution for the use and reporting of logistic regression in transplantation journals.},

However, the precise causal factors of TB emergence remain unknown.

abstract = {SETTING: A large randomized controlled trial recently showed that for treating latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) in persons at high risk of progression to tuberculosis (TB) disease, a 12-dose regimen of weekly rifapentine plus isoniazid (3HP) administered as directly observed treatment (DOT) can be as effective as 9 months of daily self-administered isoniazid (9H). OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 3HP compared to 9H. DESIGN: A computational model was designed to simulate individuals with LTBI treated with 9H or 3HP. Costs and health outcomes were estimated to determine the incremental costs per active TB case prevented and per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained by 3HP compared to 9H. RESULTS: Over a 20-year period, treatment of LTBI with 3HP rather than 9H resulted in 5.2 fewer cases of TB and 25 fewer lost QALYs per 1000 individuals treated. From the health system and societal perspectives, 3HP would cost respectively US{\$}21,525 and {\$}4294 more per TB case prevented, and respectively {\$}4565 and {\$}911 more per QALY gained. CONCLUSIONS: 3HP may be a cost-effective alternative to 9H, particularly if the cost of rifapentine decreases, the effectiveness of 3HP can be maintained without DOT, and 3HP treatment is limited to those with a high risk of progression to TB disease.},

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {The epidemiological mechanisms behind the W-shaped age-specific influenza mortality during the Spanish influenza (H1N1) pandemic 1918-19 have yet to be fully clarified. The present study aimed to develop a formal hypothesis: tuberculosis (TB) was associated with the W-shaped influenza mortality from 1918-19. Three pieces of epidemiological information were assessed: (i) the epidemic records containing the age-specific numbers of cases and deaths of influenza from 1918-19, (ii) an outbreak record of influenza in a Swiss TB sanatorium during the pandemic, and (iii) the age-dependent TB mortality over time in the early 20th century. Analyzing the data (i), we found that the W-shaped pattern was not only seen in mortality but also in the age-specific case fatality ratio, suggesting the presence of underlying age-specific risk factor(s) of influenza death among young adults. From the data (ii), TB was shown to be associated with influenza death (P = 0.09), and there was no influenza death among non-TB controls. The data (iii) were analyzed by employing the age-period-cohort model, revealing harvesting effect in the period function of TB mortality shortly after the 1918-19 pandemic. These findings suggest that it is worthwhile to further explore the role of TB in characterizing the age-specific risk of influenza death.},

abstract = {This report presents detailed data on TB case notifications made to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system (ETS) in England to the end of 2014. This is a change in presentation compared with previous TB annual reports produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Public Health England (PHE), which reported detailed surveillance data for the whole of the UK. This change is consistent with the newly launched Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020 [1], and the fact that TB control activities, along with other health services, are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The one exception is the United Kingdom tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme (chapter 10), which is conducted for the whole of the UK. High-level data on TB notifications in the UK to the end of 2014, and breakdowns by country, can be found in the Official Statistic for TB, ‘Reports of cases of tuberculosis to enhanced tuberculosis surveillance systems: United Kingdom, 2000 to 2014'. This is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-othermycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data. As part of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020, a suite of TB Strategy Monitoring Indicators have been developed (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment{\_}data/file/403231/ Collaborative{\_}TB{\_}Strategy{\_}for{\_}England{\_}2015{\_}2020{\_}.pdf). Where data for these indicators are presented in this report, the indicator name is shown, and a summary table of national-level indicators is presented in Appendix V. Data for indicators which are presented at Upper Tier Local Authority can be found at http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tb-monitoring and will be updated with data for 2014 on 6th October 2015. Hyperlinks (in green) for specific indicators are also shown throughout the report where data are presented. TB data from 2000 are updated annually to take into account denotifications, late notifications and other updates. The data from the current year's report supersedes data in previous reports. Key points and recommendations This report presents detailed data on the occurrence and management of tuberculosis (TB) in England to the end of 2014, which should be used to inform the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020.  in the past three years there has been a year on year decline in the number of TB cases in England, down to 6,520 in 2014, a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 o despite this decline, the number of TB cases in England is still unacceptably high  the recent reduction in TB cases is mainly due to a reduction in cases in the nonUK born population, which make up nearly three-quarters of all TB cases in England o this reduction is likely in part to reflect recent declines in the number of migrants from high TB burden countries and the impact of pre-entry TB screening o the majority of non-UK born cases (86{\%}) are now notified more than two years after entering the UK, and are likely to be due to reactivation of latent TB infection o the roll out of latent TB testing and treatment, and further strengthening of TB services is required to ensure that the decline in non-UK born cases is sustained  there has been no downward trend in the incidence of TB in the UK born population in the past decade, with a rate of 3.9 per 100,000 in 2014 o 15{\%} of cases in the UK born population had at least one social risk factor, and 38{\%} were from minority ethnic groups  there is some evidence of a recent reduction in transmission of TB in England, with a decline in TB incidence in UK born children in the past six years o more substantial reductions in transmission will require improvements in early diagnosis, contact tracing and further improvements in treatment completion  treatment completion for drug sensitive cases has been improving over the past decade, with corresponding reductions in deaths and losses to follow-up  there has been a recent reduction in the number of new cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with 52 new cases diagnosed in 2014  nearly half of drug resistant cases with MDR/rifampicin resistant-TB (MDR/RRTB) notified in 2012 had not completed treatment by 24 months; these patients require specialised clinical management and considerable social support to achieve favourable outcomes Tuberculosis in England: 2015 report (presenting data to end of 2014) 8  the average delay from symptom onset to treatment start is unacceptably long and increasing; nearly one-third of pulmonary TB cases had a delay of more than four months in 2014 o to reduce this delay, improved awareness in affected communities and among health professionals, and improved access to high quality services are required  nearly one in ten TB cases in 2014 had at least one social risk factor, and there has been no reduction in the number of cases with social risk factors over the past five years o a higher proportion of those with social risk factors have drug resistant TB and worse TB outcomes, which highlights the added importance of tackling TB in this group, including through targeted outreach services  to achieve further reductions in TB in England over the next five years, including in new and settled migrant populations, in the UK born population, and among the most vulnerable groups, we need to build upon existing achievements and address gaps in current service provision; this will require the sustained and coordinated action of all key stakeholders, supported and overseen by the newly established TB control boards and national TB programme office},

To facilitate work in such countries, a simple epidemiological model was made to calculate annual trends in the prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis and its infection, in tuberculosis mortality, and in BCG coverage, using average parameter values not specific for age groups or birth year cohorts. To test its approximation capabilities and limits, the model was applied to epidemiological data from Japan, where sufficient information was available from repeated nation-wide sample surveys and national statistics. The approximation was found to be satisfactory within certain limits. The model is best used with a desk-top computer, but the calculations can be performed with a small calculator or even by hand.},

abstract = {The development of diagnostic tests which can readily differentiate between vaccinated and tuberculosis-infected individuals is crucial for the wider utilization of bacillus Calmette-Gu??rin (BCG) as vaccine in humans and animals. BCG{\_}0092 is an antigen that elicits specific delayed type hypersensitivity reactions similar in size and morphological aspects to that elicited by purified protein derivative, in both animals and humans infected with the tubercle bacilli. We carried out bioinformatics analyses of the BCG{\_}0092 and designed a diagnostic test by using the predicted MHC class I epitopes. In addition, we performed a knockout of this gene by homologous recombination in the BCG vaccine strain to allow differentiation of vaccinated from infected individuals. For that, the flanking sequences of the target gene (BCG{\_}0092) were cloned into a suicide vector. Spontaneous double crossovers, which result in wild type revertants or knockouts were selected using SacB. BCG{\_}0092 is present only in members of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex. Eight predicted MHC class I epitopes with potential for immunological diagnosis were defined, allowing the design of a specific diagnostic test. The strategy used to delete the (BCG{\_}0092) gene from BCG was successful. The knockout genotype was confirmed by PCR and by Southern blot. The mutant BCG strain has the potential of inducing protection against tuberculosis without interfering with the diagnostic test based on the use of selected epitopes from BCG{\_}0092. ?? 2012 Elsevier Editora Ltda.},

There is presently no direct means to identify individuals in whom Mtb infection has been eradicated, whether by a bactericidal immune response or sterilizing antimicrobial chemotherapy. Mathematical models can assist in such circumstances by measuring or predicting events that cannot be directly observed. The 3 models discussed in this review illustrate instances in which mathematical models were used to identify individuals with innate resistance to Mtb infection, determine the etiologic mechanism of tuberculosis in patients treated with tumor necrosis factor blockers, and predict the risk of relapse in persons undergoing tuberculosis treatment.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We estimated the potential impact and cost-effectiveness of providing 3-doses of nonavalent human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine (9vHPV) to females aged 13-18 years who had previously completed a series of quadrivalent HPV vaccine (4vHPV), a strategy we refer to as "additional 9vHPV vaccination." METHODS: We used 2 distinct models: (1) the simplified model, which is among the most basic of the published dynamic HPV models, and (2) the US HPV-ADVISE model, a complex, stochastic, individual-based transmission-dynamic model. RESULTS: When assuming no 4vHPV cross-protection, the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained by additional 9vHPV vaccination was {\$}146 200 in the simplified model and {\$}108 200 in the US HPV-ADVISE model ({\$}191 800 when assuming 4vHPV cross-protection). In 1-way sensitivity analyses in the scenario of no 4vHPV cross-protection, the simplified model results ranged from {\$}70 300 to {\$}182 000, and the US HPV-ADVISE model results ranged from {\$}97 600 to {\$}118 900. CONCLUSIONS: The average cost per QALY gained by additional 9vHPV vaccination exceeded {\$}100 000 in both models. However, the results varied considerably in sensitivity and uncertainty analyses. Additional 9vHPV vaccination is likely not as efficient as many other potential HPV vaccination strategies, such as increasing primary 9vHPV vaccine coverage.},

@article{Krsulovic2016,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The global spread of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the main hypothesis behind tuberculosis (TB) positive trends in the last decades, according to modeling studies and World Health Organization Reports (WHO). On one hand, TB (WHO) reports do not explicitly consider a modeling approach, but cover country and global TB trends. On the other hand, modeling studies usually do not cover the scale of WHO reports, because of the amount of parameters estimated to describe TB natural history. Here we combined these two principal sources of TB studies covering TB High Burden Countries (HBCs) dynamics. Our main goals were: (i) to detect the endogenous component of TB dynamics since 1974 for TB HBCs; and (ii) to explore the HIV exogenous effects on TB models`parameters. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We explored the relationship between the TB per capita population rate of change (RI) and the infectious class size following an endogenous/exogenous framework. RI can be affected by intra-population processes (i.e. competition, predation) and exogenous variables like HIV. We found that TB dynamics had always a strong endogenous component, represented by a negative correlation between TB population size and RI, which was captured by the discrete logistic model. Moreover, we explored the HIV exogenous effects on TB models`parameters. We found that overall the TB+HIV logistic model was more parsimonious than TB model alone, principally in the African region. Our results showed that HIV affected principally TB carrying capacity, as expected by the known HIV effects on TB natural-history. We also tested if DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-Course Strategy), poverty levels and BCG (Bacillus Calmette-Guerin) coverage explained the models residuals variances, but they did not. CONCLUSIONS: Since 1974, TB dynamics were categorized in distinct chronological domains, with different dynamics but nearly the same underlying mechanism: a negative relationship between RI and infected class size (i.e. self-limiting). In the last decades, not only HIV spread represented a new TB chronological domain, but it also has been pushing TB carrying capacity (K) to higher levels. TB has a complex natural-history and imposes real challenges to model its dynamics. Yet, we were able to explore and reveal the main drivers of TB dynamics for HBCs since 1974, through a simple approach. Based on our results, we suggest that the endogenous view should be considered as a plausible hypothesis to model and explain TB dynamics and that future World Health Organization reports could include the endogenous/exogenous framework as a supplement to help to decipher the main drivers of TB dynamics and other diseases.},

abstract = {SETTING: Inaccurate diagnosis and inaccessibility of care undercut the effectiveness of high-quality anti-tuberculosis treatment and select for resistance. Rapid diagnostic systems, such as Xpert((R)) MTB/RIF for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and drug susceptibility testing (DST), and programs that provide high-quality DOTS anti-tuberculosis treatment to patients in the unregulated private sector (public-private mix [PPM]), may help address these challenges, albeit at increased cost. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We extended a microsimulation model of TB in India calibrated to demographic, epidemiologic, and care trends to evaluate 1) replacing DST with Xpert; 2) replacing microscopy and culture with Xpert to diagnose multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) and non-MDR-TB; 3) implementing nationwide PPM; and combinations of (3) with (1) or (2). RESULTS: PPM (assuming costs of {\$}38/person) and Xpert improved health and increase costs relative to the status quo. PPM alone or with Xpert cost {\textless}1 gross domestic product/capita per quality-adjusted life-year gained relative to the next best intervention, and dominated Xpert interventions excluding PPM. CONCLUSIONS: While both PPM and Xpert are promising tools for combatting TB in India, PPM should be prioritized over Xpert, as private sector engagement is more cost-effective than Xpert alone and, if sufficient resources are available, would substantially increase the value of Xpert if both interventions are implemented together.},

abstract = {Many aspects of the natural history of tuberculosis are poorly understood. Though it is recognized that clinical tuberculosis may follow shortly after initial infection ('primary' disease), or many years thereafter through either endogenous reactivation or after reinfection, the relative importance of these mechanisms is often disputed. The issue is complicated by the fact that the risks of developing disease are age-dependent, and reflect infection risks which may change over time. This paper estimates the age-dependent risks of developing tuberculosis using an age-structured deterministic model of the dynamics of tuberculous infection and disease in England and Wales since 1900. The work extends the classical studies of Sutherland and colleagues. The best estimates of the risks of developing 'primary' disease (within 5 years of initial infection) were approximately 4{\%}, 9{\%} and 14{\%} for individuals infected at ages 0-10, 15 years and over 20 years respectively, and a previous infection appeared to impart little protection against (further) reinfection, but 16-41{\%} protection against disease subsequent to reinfection for adolescents and adults. We also provide evidence that reinfection made an important contribution to tuberculous morbidity in the past, as (i) exclusion of exogenous disease from the model considerably worsened the fit to observed notification rates, and (ii) the dramatic decline in the risk of tuberculous infection from 1950 in England and Wales accelerated the decline in morbidity among all individuals, even among the older age groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection. We conclude that the risk of infection is the single most important factor affecting the magnitude of the tuberculous morbidity in a population, as it determines both the age pattern of initial infection (and hence the risk of developing disease) and the risk of reinfection.},

We show that the epidemic of resistance is being generated mainly by the conversion of drug-sensitive cases to drug-resistant cases, and not by the transmission of resistant strains. We also show that transmission of resistant strains has not increased the overall number of new HIV infections.

abstract = {Tuberculosis is an old disease which co-exists with humans. It claims for over 10 million new infections and deaths annually. According to the World Health Organization TB facts, about one-third of the world's population has latent TB, and drug resistant strains have been found in all countries surveyed.(1,2) With rapid spread of multi-drug resistance, TB has become a global public health challenge. Understanding the dynamics of TB infection and the interplay between confounding factors involved in the emergence and spread of drug-resistance is crucial for addressing this growing challenge. While mathematical models have contributed to enhance our understanding of the TB infection mechanisms and control,(3-6) the perplexity of this disease calls for application of more advanced and computationally sophisticated methods. 7 Here, we propose an agent-based modelling computational system as a general framework to study TB infection and interrelated processes. This framework includes two strains of TB, namely drug-sensitive and drug-resistant, and encapsulates principal mechanisms of latent, endogenous, exogenous, and relapse infection. This paper is concerned with the development of this framework both epidemiologically and computationally, with methodologies for model implementation. Using this model, we provide a new pathway towards evaluating treatment strategies for curtailing TB drug-resistant infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a high burden for Human society despite considerable investments in its control. Unique features in the history of infection and transmission dynamics of tuberculosis pose serious limitations on the direct interpretation of surveillance data and call for models that incorporate latent processes and simulate specific interventions. METHODS: A transmission model was adjusted to the dataset of active tuberculosis cases reported in Portugal between 2002 and 2009. We estimated key transmission parameters from the data (i.e. time to diagnosis, treatment length, default proportion, proportion of pulmonary TB cases). Using the adjusted model to the Portuguese case, we estimated the total burden of tuberculosis in Portugal. We further performed sensitivity analysis to heterogeneities in susceptibility to infection and exposure intensity. RESULTS: We calculated a mean time to diagnose of 2.81 months and treatment length of 8.80 months in Portugal. The proportion defaulting treatment was calculated as 0.04 and the proportion of pulmonary cases as 0.75. Using these values, we estimated a TB burden of 1.6 million infected persons, corresponding to more than 15{\%} of the Portuguese population. We further described the sensitivity of these estimates to heterogeneity. CONCLUSIONS: We showed that the model reproduces well the observed dynamics of the Portuguese data, thus demonstrating its adequacy for devising control strategies for TB and predicting the effects of interventions.},

This study provides a review of earlier study on modeling different aspects of tuberculosis dynamics.

abstract = {A tuberculosis model which incorporates treatment of infectives and chemoprophylaxis is presented. The model assumes that latently infected individuals develop active disease as a result of endogenous re-activation, exogenous re-infection and disease relapse, though a small fraction is assumed to develop active disease soon after infection. We start by formulating and analyzing a TB model without any intervention strategy that we extend to incorporate chemoprophylaxis and treatment of infectives. The epidemic thresholds known as reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined, and stabilities analyzed. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the possible community benefits achieved by treatment of infectives, chemoprophylaxis and a holistic approach of these intervention strategies. The study shows that treatment of infectives is more effective in the first years of implementation (approximately 10 years) as treatment results in clearing active TB immediately and there after chemoprophylaxis will do better in controlling the number of infectives due to reduced progression to active TB.},

abstract = {Subjectivism has become the dominant philosophical foundation for Bayesian inference. Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices. We also provide an annotated bibliography.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: There is only limited economic data in head-to head comparison between a whole blood QuantiFERON TB Gold in tube (QFT) and the tuberculin skin test (TST) when screening and treating for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), and no published study to date that takes into account the predictive value of the two tests. METHODS: Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) of close contacts were compared in a decision tree model to perform a cost-benefit analysis with respect to isoniazid related hepatotoxicity and early post-exposure TB over a 2-y period, using the QFT or TST alone or QFT as a confirmatory test for TST results. RESULTS: Cost of screening and treating for using the QFT alone amounted to euro215.79 per close contact, less than that of dual step-testing (euro227.89) or using TST alone (euro232.58). Savings amounted to euro12,200 or euro16,791 per 1000 close contacts, respectively. QFT based procedures were most sensitive to low compliance with IPT or increasing price. Costs of dual step screening was mostly influenced by cost of treating TB disease. When the progression rate for QFT was lowered to that for the TST in a sensitivity analysis, the relationship between the strategies remained robust. In addition, costs of the QFT strategy decreased to euro165.1, and those of the dual step strategy to euro218.4. CONCLUSION: IPT on the basis of using the QFT assay alone produces less cost and reduces more TB cases than other strategies in a low-incidence setting. These data have implications for the rational implementation of screening strategies in contact investigation.},

@article{Uys2008,
abstract = {In a significant number of instances, an episode of tuberculosis can be attributed to a reinfection event. Because reinfection is more likely in high incidence regions than in regions of low incidence, more tuberculosis (TB) cases due to reinfection could be expected in high-incidence regions than in low-incidence regions. Empirical data from regions with various incidence rates appear to confirm the conjecture that, in fact, the incidence rate due to reinfection only, as a proportion of all cases, correlates with the logarithm of the incidence rate, rather than with the incidence rate itself. A theoretical model that supports this conjecture is presented. A Markov model was used to obtain a relationship between incidence and reinfection rates. It was assumed in this model that the rate of reinfection is a multiple, rho (the reinfection factor), of the rate of first-time infection, lambda. The results obtained show a relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the rate of incidence that is approximately logarithmic for a range of values of the incidence rate typical of those observed in communities across the globe. A value of rho is determined such that the relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the logarithm of the incidence rate closely correlates with empirical data. From a purely theoretical investigation, it is shown that a simple relationship can be expected between the logarithm of the incidence rates and the proportions of cases due to reinfection after a prior episode of TB. This relationship is sustained by a rate of reinfection that is higher than the rate of first-time infection and this latter consideration underscores the great importance of monitoring recovered TB cases for repeat disease episodes, especially in regions where TB incidence is high. Awareness of this may assist in attempts to control the epidemic.},

Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE AND DESIGN: The increased risk for tuberculosis in HIV-infected people has fueled a worldwide resurgence of tuberculosis. A major hindrance to controlling tuberculosis is the long treatment duration, leading to default, jeopardizing cure, and generating drug resistance. We investigated how tuberculosis is impacted by reducing treatment duration alone or combined with enhanced case detection and/or cure under different HIV prevalence levels. METHODS: Our model includes HIV stages I-IV and was calibrated to long-term tuberculosis and HIV data from Kenya. Benefits were assessed in terms of absolute and relative reductions in new tuberculosis cases and deaths. RESULTS: Compared with present-day strategies, at 3-20{\%} HIV prevalence we attain a 6-20{\%} decrease in incidence and mortality in 25 years when reducing treatment duration alone; benefits exceed 300{\%} when combined with increased detection and cure. Benefits vary substantially according to HIV status and prevalence. Challenges arise because in absolute terms the number of infected people and deaths increases dramatically with increasing HIV prevalence, and because the relative efficacy of tuberculosis control policies displays a nonlinear pattern whereby they become less effective on a per capita basis at HIV prevalence levels greater than 15{\%}. Benefits of reducing treatment duration may even be reversed at extreme HIV prevalence levels. Benefits of increasing cure versus detection increase as HIV prevalence increases. CONCLUSION: Reducing tuberculosis treatment duration, alone or in combination with other control strategies, can provide enormous benefits at high HIV prevalence. Tuberculosis control policies need to account for HIV levels because the efficacy of different interventions varies substantially with HIV prevalence.},

It is assumed that the treated individuals may enter either the latent compartment due to the remainder of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or the infectious compartment due to the treatment failure. The first model is a simple one with treatment failure reflecting the current TB treatment fact in most countries with high tuberculosis incidence. The second model refines the simple one by dividing the latent compartment into slow and fast two kinds of progresses. This improvement can be used to describe the case that the latent TB individuals have been infected with some other chronic diseases (such as HIV and diabetes) which may weaken the immunity of infected individuals and shorten the latent period of TB. Both of the two models assume mass action incidence and exponential distributions of transfers between different compartments. The basic reproduction numbers of the two models are derived and their intuitive epidemiological interpretations are given. The global dynamics of two models are all proved by using Liapunov functions. At last, some strategies to control the spread of tuberculosis are discussed. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) are major health problems in Western Province, Papua New Guinea. While comprehensive expansion of TB control programs is desirable, logistical challenges are considerable, and there is substantial uncertainty regarding the true disease burden. We parameterized our previously described mathematical model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis dynamics in Western Province, following an epidemiologic assessment. Five hypothetical scenarios representing alternative programmatic approaches during the period from 2013 to 2023 were developed with local staff. Bayesian uncertainty analyses were undertaken to explicitly acknowledge the uncertainty around key epidemiologic parameters, and an economic evaluation was performed. With continuation of existing programmatic strategies, overall TB incidence remained stable at 555 cases per 100,000 population per year (95{\%} simulation interval (SI): 420, 807), but the proportion of incident cases attributable to MDR-TB increased from 16{\%} to 35{\%}. Comprehensive, provincewide strengthening of existing programs reduced incidence to 353 cases per 100,000 population per year (95{\%} SI: 246, 558), with 46{\%} being cases of MDR-TB, while incorporating programmatic management of MDR-TB into these programs reduced incidence to 233 cases per 100,000 population per year (95{\%} SI: 198, 269) with 14{\%} MDR-TB. Most economic costs were due to hospitalization during the intensive treatment phase. Broad scale-up of TB control activities in Western Province with incorporation of programmatic management of MDR-TB is vital if control is to be achieved. Community-based treatment approaches are important to reduce the associated economic costs.},

abstract = {A variety of filtering methods enable the recursive estimation of system state variables and inference of model parameters. These methods have found application in a range of disciplines and settings, including engineering design and forecasting, and, over the last two decades, have been applied to infectious disease epidemiology. For any system of interest, the ideal filter depends on the nonlinearity and complexity of the model to which it is applied, the quality and abundance of observations being entrained, and the ultimate application (e.g. forecast, parameter estimation, etc.). Here, we compare the performance of six state-of-the-art filter methods when used to model and forecast influenza activity. Three particle filters--a basic particle filter (PF) with resampling and regularization, maximum likelihood estimation via iterated filtering (MIF), and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo (pMCMC)--and three ensemble filters--the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), the ensemble adjustment Kalman filter (EAKF), and the rank histogram filter (RHF)--were used in conjunction with a humidity-forced susceptible-infectious-recovered-susceptible (SIRS) model and weekly estimates of influenza incidence. The modeling frameworks, first validated with synthetic influenza epidemic data, were then applied to fit and retrospectively forecast the historical incidence time series of seven influenza epidemics during 2003-2012, for 115 cities in the United States. Results suggest that when using the SIRS model the ensemble filters and the basic PF are more capable of faithfully recreating historical influenza incidence time series, while the MIF and pMCMC do not perform as well for multimodal outbreaks. For forecast of the week with the highest influenza activity, the accuracies of the six model-filter frameworks are comparable; the three particle filters perform slightly better predicting peaks 1-5 weeks in the future; the ensemble filters are more accurate predicting peaks in the past.},

It is assumed in the model that the treated individuals may enter either the latent compartment due to the remainder of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or the infectious compartment due to the treatment failure. It is shown that the global transmission dynamics of the disease is fully determined by the basic reproduction number. The asymptotic smoothness of the semi-flow generated by the system is established. By analyzing the corresponding characteristic equations, the local stability of a disease-free steady state and an endemic steady state of the model is established. By using the persistence theory for infinite dimensional system, the uniform persistence of the system is established when the basic reproduction number is greater than unity. By means of suitable Lyapunov functionals and LaSalle's invariance principle, it is proven that if the basic reproduction number is less than unity, the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable; if the basic reproduction number is greater than unity, the endemic steady state is globally asymptotically stable.},

abstract = {Despite current control efforts, global tuberculosis (TB) incidence is decreasing slowly. New regimens that can shorten treatment hold promise for improving treatment completion and success, but their impact on population-level transmission remains unclear. Earlier models projected that a four-month regimen could reduce TB incidence by 10{\%} but assumed that an entire course of therapy must be completed to derive any benefit. We constructed a dynamic transmission model of TB disease calibrated to global estimates of incidence, prevalence, mortality, and treatment success. To account for the efficacy of partial treatment, we used data from clinical trials of early short-course regimens to estimate relapse rates among TB patients who completed one-third, one-half, two-thirds, and all of their first-line treatment regimens. We projected population-level incidence and mortality over 10 years, comparing standard six-month therapy to hypothetical shorter-course regimens with equivalent treatment success but fewer defaults. The impact of hypothetical four-month regimens on TB incidence after 10 years was smaller than estimated in previous modeling analyses (1.9{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty range 0.6-3.1{\%}] vs. 10{\%}). Impact on TB mortality was larger (3.5{\%} at 10 years) but still modest. Transmission impact was most sensitive to the proportion of patients completing therapy: four-month therapy led to greater incidence reductions in settings where 25{\%} of patients leave care ("default") over six months. Our findings remained robust under one-way variation of model parameters. These findings suggest that novel regimens that shorten treatment duration may have only a modest effect on TB transmission except in settings of very low treatment completion.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of directly observed treatment compared to conventional therapy in reducing the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, for an industrialised country (represented by the United States of America) and a developing country (South Africa). METHODS: Monte Carlo analysis using published data on probability, cost and health impact. RESULTS: In both countries, directly observed treatment is the dominant strategy, yielding cost savings and improved health outcomes. Cost savings for directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy become more significant as more expensive second-line drugs are used in treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The cost-effectiveness of directly observed treatment relative to conventional therapy is demonstrated for both the USA and South Africa. Cost savings are more pronounced (especially for South Africa) as the likelihood of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis increases and more expensive second-line therapies are used. Given that health care resources are more severely constrained in developing countries, the data contained in this study are useful in guiding the design of policies for the effective management of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in settings with limited resources.},

The epidemic in this region is exacerbated by the presence of drug-resistant TB strains as well as HIV infection. This presents a public health threat not only locally but also to Australia due to the high potential for cross-border transmission between PNG's Western Province and the Australian Torres Strait Islands. We present two mathematical models of TB in the Western Province: a simple model of the underlying TB dynamics, and a detailed model which accounts for the additional effects of HIV and drug resistance. The detailed model is used to make quantitative predictions about the impact of expanding the TB case detection rate under the Directly Observed Treatment, Short-course treatment regimen. This paper provides a framework for future investigation into the economic costs and public health benefits of potential TB interventions in this region, with the eventual aim of providing recommendations to guide policy makers in both PNG and Australia.},

abstract = {The model herein aims to explore the dynamics of the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in an informal settlement or township. The population is divided into households of various sizes and also based on commuting status. The model dynamics distinguishes between three distinct social patterns: the exposure of commuters during travel, random diurnal interaction and familial exposure at night. Following the general SLIR models, the population is further segmented into susceptible (S), exposed/latently infected (L), active/infectious (I), and recovered (R) individuals. During the daytime, commuters travel on public transport, while non-commuters randomly interact in the community to mimic chance encounters with infectious persons. At night, each family interacts and sleeps together in the home. The risk of exposure to TB is based on the proximity, duration, and frequency of encounters with infectious persons. The model is applied to a hypothetical population to explore the effects of different intervention strategies including vaccination, wearing of masks during the commute, prophylactic treatment of latent infections and more effective case-finding and treatment. The most important findings of the model are: (1) members of larger families are responsible for more disease transmissions than those from smaller families, (2) daily commutes on public transport provide ideal conditions for transmission of the disease, (3) improved diagnosis and treatment has the greatest impact on the spread of the disease, and (4) detecting TB at the first clinic visit, when patients are still smear negative, is key.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Accurate assessment of the burden of drug-resistant TB requires systematic efforts to quantify its magnitude and trend. In approximately half the countries where resistance has been reported, estimates are based on surveys conducted in public sector facilities. However, in locations where a substantial fraction of TB cases seek care with private providers, these surveys may not accurately measure resistance in the entire population. METHODS: We describe a mathematical model to investigate biases associated with sampling only from public sector cases in India, where TB treatment is offered in both public and private sectors. We then propose and demonstrate a weighted estimator as an efficient method for including small numbers of cases from the private sector as a way to recover valid estimates of resistance in the population under study. RESULTS: We find that public sector surveys rarely provide valid estimates of drug-resistance among new and retreatment cases. Further, the magnitude and direction of the bias are sensitive to many parameters describing the health-seeking behaviours and treatment outcomes of tuberculosis patients, disallowing simple adjustments to recover accurate estimates. CONCLUSIONS: In locations where large numbers of tuberculosis patients are diagnosed and treated by private sector practitioners who are not typically included in drug resistance surveys, targeted surveys for assessing drug resistance are required to validly estimate resistance.},

abstract = {An epidemiological model was used to estimate the size of the tuberculosis problem in Singapore from 1975 to 2025. It was shown that even without any control activities after 1979 there would be a reduction of the tuberculosis indices in the country. If the present control programme was pursued unchanged, a reduction of the tuberculosis problem by 10.0{\%} and 14.5{\%} would be expected in 2000 and 2025 respectively. Tuberculosis would be expected to remain a major public health problem over the next fifty years. In Singapore's context increased case finding and treatment of bacteriologically positive cases of tuberculosis would be the most effective ways of further reducing the tuberculosis problem over the next fifty years. Practical methods of implementing this were suggested. Reduced BCG coverage of infants was not expected to increase the tuberculosis problem to any significant extent over this period. Treatment relapse rates were shown not to be a sensitive variable that would affect the tuberculosis problem in Singapore.},

The focus is on three types of models: a standard incidence homogeneous mixing model, a non-homogeneous mixing model that incorporates 'household' contacts, and an age-structured model. The models are parameterized using demographic and epidemiological data and the patterns generated from these models are compared. Furthermore, the effects of population growth, stochasticity, clustering of contacts, and age structure on disease dynamics are explored. This framework is used to asses the possible causes for the observed historical decline of tuberculosis notifications.},

abstract = {All adult immigrant applicants to Canada undergo chest radiographic screening for tuberculosis (TB). Tuberculin skin testing could reduce the number of chest X-rays, and identify more candidates for prophylaxis. We modeled the cost-effectiveness of chest radiography and tuberculin skin testing for TB prevention over a 20-yr time frame, among three simulated cohorts of 20-yr-old immigrants. Compared with no screening, radiographic screening prevented 4.3{\%} of expected active TB cases in the highest risk cohort (50{\%} TB-infected, 10{\%} human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] seroprevalence), and 8.0{\%} in the lowest risk cohort (5{\%} TB-infected, 1{\%} HIV seroprevalence). Tuberculin skin testing further reduced the expected incidence 8.0{\%} and 4.0{\%}, respectively. Compared with no screening, radiographic screening cost {\$}3,943 Canadian per active TB case prevented in the highest risk cohort, and {\$}236,496 per case prevented in the lowest risk group. Compared with radiographic screening, mass tuberculin skin testing cost {\$}32,601 per additional case prevented in the highest risk group, and {\$}68,799 per additional case prevented in the lowest risk group. Chest radiographic screening of young immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of TB is a relatively inexpensive means of TB prevention. Tuberculin skin testing is considerably less cost-effective. For immigrants from low-prevalence countries, both interventions are extremely costly with negligible impact. The cost-effectiveness of either strategy would be greatly enhanced by increased adherence to chemoprophylaxis recommendations. Radiographic screening of groups with a high prevalence of tuberculous infection will then likely save money.},

abstract = {Background: The potential population-level impact of private-sector initiatives for tuberculosis (TB) case finding in Southeast Asia remains uncertain. In 2011, the Indus Hospital TB Control Program in Karachi, Pakistan, undertook an aggressive case-finding campaign that doubled notification rates, providing an opportunity to investigate potential population-level effects. Methods: We constructed an age-structured compartmental model of TB in the intervention area. We fit the model using field and literature data, assuming that TB incidence equaled the estimated nationwide incidence in Pakistan (primary analysis), or 1.5 times greater (high-incidence scenario). We modeled the intervention as an increase in the rate of formal-sector TB diagnosis and evaluated the potential impact of sustaining this rate for five years. Results: In the primary analysis, the five-year intervention averted 24{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range, UR: 18-30{\%}) of five-year cumulative TB cases and 52{\%} (95{\%} UR: 45-57{\%}) of cumulative TB deaths. Corresponding reductions in the high-incidence scenario were 12{\%} (95{\%} UR: 8-17{\%}) and 27{\%} (95{\%} UR: 21-34{\%}), although the absolute number of lives saved was higher. At the end of five years, TB notification rates in the primary analysis were below their 2010 baseline, incidence had dropped by 45{\%}, and annual mortality had fallen by 72{\%}. About half of the cumulative impact on incidence and mortality could be achieved with a one-year intervention. Conclusions: Sustained, multifaceted, and innovative approaches to TB case-finding in Asian megacities can have substantial community-wide epidemiological impact.},

This article provides a detailed review of the work on the dynamics and control of TB. The earliest mathematical models describing the TB dynamics appeared in the 1960s and focused on the prediction and control strategies using simulation approaches. Most recently developed models not only pay attention to simulations but also take care of dynamical analysis using modern knowledge of dynamical systems. Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) (both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models.},

To construct an appropriate model, we have analysed (using LogLet decomposition method) epidemiological World Health Organization (WHO) data (period 1980-2014) and obtained, as result of their integration, a curve approximated by a bi-logistic function. This fact allows a subdivision of the whole population into parts, each of them satisfies the Verhulst-like models with different constant virulences introduced into each subsystem separately. Such a subdivision could be interconnected with the heterogeneous structure of mycobacterial population that has a high ability of adaptation to the host and strong mutability.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: People who live under fragile living conditions may stay overnight in Internet cafes in urban areas. An outbreak of tuberculosis (TB), the routes of which were possibly related to such a facility, has been reported. The purpose of this study was to use a mathematical model to quantify the public health risk of TB infection in such a facility. METHODS: The reproduction number for airborne infection in an enclosed space (R (A)) was estimated using a Wells-Riley model. First, we estimated R (A) for the TB infection based on the report of the TB outbreak in the Internet cafe. Second, TB infectious dose, number of days of exposure, and air-exchange rate in the facility were varied to estimate the effect of TB risk settings and environmental factors. RESULTS: We assumed that TB patients and 59 susceptible subjects stayed for 150 days in a room where the air-exchange rate was five per hour. Using the estimated median R (A) of 44.14, the TB infection rate was 74.6{\%}. This result was similar to the epidemiological report that the TB infection rate among employees in the Internet cafe was 70{\%}. The median R (A) increased linearly as the number of days of exposure increased. The slope of the change in median R (A) divided by the change in the number of days of exposure increased exponentially as air-exchange rate decreased; thus air ventilation in a facility may be essential to prevent TB infection. CONCLUSIONS: Appropriate air ventilation in facilities such as Internet cafes is needed as part of a TB-control program in metropolitan areas.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Novel drug regimens are needed for tuberculosis (TB) treatment. New regimens aim to improve on characteristics such as duration, efficacy, and safety profile, but no single regimen is likely to be ideal in all respects. By linking these regimen characteristics to a novel regimen's ability to reduce TB incidence and mortality, we sought to prioritize regimen characteristics from a population-level perspective. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic transmission model of multi-strain TB epidemics in hypothetical populations reflective of the epidemiological situations in India (primary analysis), South Africa, the Philippines, and Brazil. We modeled the introduction of various novel rifampicin-susceptible (RS) or rifampicin-resistant (RR) TB regimens that differed on six characteristics, identified in consultation with a team of global experts: (1) efficacy, (2) duration, (3) ease of adherence, (4) medical contraindications, (5) barrier to resistance, and (6) baseline prevalence of resistance to the novel regimen. We compared scale-up of these regimens to a baseline reflective of continued standard of care. For our primary analysis situated in India, our model generated baseline TB incidence and mortality of 157 (95{\%} uncertainty range [UR]: 113-187) and 16 (95{\%} UR: 9-23) per 100,000 per year at the time of novel regimen introduction and RR TB incidence and mortality of 6 (95{\%} UR: 4-10) and 0.6 (95{\%} UR: 0.3-1.1) per 100,000 per year. An optimal RS TB regimen was projected to reduce 10-y TB incidence and mortality in the India-like scenario by 12{\%} (95{\%} UR: 6{\%}-20{\%}) and 11{\%} (95{\%} UR: 6{\%}-20{\%}), respectively, compared to current-care projections. An optimal RR TB regimen reduced RR TB incidence by an estimated 32{\%} (95{\%} UR: 18{\%}-46{\%}) and RR TB mortality by 30{\%} (95{\%} UR: 18{\%}-44{\%}). Efficacy was the greatest determinant of impact; compared to a novel regimen meeting all minimal targets only, increasing RS TB treatment efficacy from 94{\%} to 99{\%} reduced TB mortality by 6{\%} (95{\%} UR: 1{\%}-13{\%}, half the impact of a fully optimized regimen), and increasing the efficacy against RR TB from 76{\%} to 94{\%} lowered RR TB mortality by 13{\%} (95{\%} UR: 6{\%}-23{\%}). Reducing treatment duration or improving ease of adherence had smaller but still substantial impact: shortening RS TB treatment duration from 6 to 2 mo lowered TB mortality by 3{\%} (95{\%} UR: 1{\%}-6{\%}), and shortening RR TB treatment from 20 to 6 mo reduced RR TB mortality by 8{\%} (95{\%} UR: 4{\%}-13{\%}), while reducing nonadherence to the corresponding regimens by 50{\%} reduced TB and RR TB mortality by 2{\%} (95{\%} UR: 1{\%}-4{\%}) and 6{\%} (95{\%} UR: 3{\%}-10{\%}), respectively. Limitations include sparse data on key model parameters and necessary simplifications to model structure and outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: In designing clinical trials of novel TB regimens, investigators should consider that even small changes in treatment efficacy may have considerable impact on TB-related incidence and mortality. Other regimen improvements may still have important benefits for resource allocation and outcomes such as patient quality of life.},

In this decade, CPUs for personal computers have acquired new features, such as Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) operations (i.e., 128-bit operations) and multi-stage pipelines. Here we propose a 128-bit based PRNG, named SIMD-oriented Fast Mersenne Twister (SFMT), which is analogous to MT but making full use of these features. Its recursion fits pipeline processing better than MT, and it is roughly twice as fast as optimised MT using SIMD operations. Moreover, the dimension of equidistribution of SFMT is better than MT. We also introduce a block-generation function, which fills an array of 32-bit integers in one call. It speeds up the generation by a factor of two. A speed comparison with other modern generators, such as multiplicative recursive generators, shows an advantage of SFMT.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{\{}R1, R2{\}}. The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this model. We find that if R {\textless} 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textless} 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can coexist with HIV when R2 {\textgreater} 1. In other words, in the case when R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1 (or when R1 {\textgreater} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1), we are able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases with R2 {\textgreater} 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations, we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii) the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in the system.},

The widespread distribution of blaCMY-2 plasmids may be driven by antibiotic use that selects for the dissemination and persistence of these plasmids. Alternatively, these plasmids may persist and spread in bacterial populations in the absence of selection pressure if a balance exists among conjugative transfer, segregation loss during cell division, and fitness cost to the host. We conducted a series of experiments (both in vivo and in vitro) to study these mechanisms for three blaCMY-2 plasmids, peH4H, pAR060302, and pAM04528. Results of filter mating experiments showed that the conjugation efficiency of blaCMY-2 plasmids is variable, from {\textless}10(-7) for pAM04528 and peH4H to ∼10(-3) for pAR060302. Neither peH4H nor pAM04528 was transferred from Escherichia coli strain DH10B, but peH4H was apparently mobilized by the coresident trimethoprim resistance-encoding plasmid pTmpR. Competition studies showed that carriage of blaCMY-2 plasmids imposed a measurable fitness cost on the host bacteria both in vitro (0.095 to 0.25) and in vivo (dairy calf model). Long-term passage experiments in the absence of antibiotics demonstrated that plasmids with limited antibiotic resistance phenotypes arose, but eventually drug-sensitive, plasmid-free clones dominated the populations. Given that plasmid decay or loss is inevitable, we infer that some level of selection is required for the long-term persistence of blaCMY-2 plasmids in bacterial populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Several promising new diagnostic methods and algorithms for tuberculosis have been endorsed by WHO. National tuberculosis programmes now face the decision on which methods to implement and where to place them in the diagnostic algorithm. METHODS: We used an integrated model to assess the effects of different algorithms of Xpert MTB/RIF and light-emitting diode (LED) fluorescence microscopy in Tanzania. To understand the effects of new diagnostics from the patient, health system, and population perspective, the model incorporated and linked a detailed operational component and a transmission component. The model was designed to represent the operational and epidemiological context of Tanzania and was used to compare the effects and cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic options. FINDINGS: Among the diagnostic options considered, we identified three strategies as cost effective in Tanzania. Full scale-up of Xpert would have the greatest population-level effect with the highest incremental cost: 346 000 disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) averted with an additional cost of US{\$}36.9 million over 10 years. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of Xpert scale-up ({\$}169 per DALY averted, 95{\%} credible interval [CrI] 104-265) is below the willingness-to-pay threshold ({\$}599) for Tanzania. Same-day LED fluorescence microscopy is the next most effective strategy with an ICER of {\$}45 (95{\%} CrI 25-74), followed by LED fluorescence microscopy with an ICER of {\$}29 (6-59). Compared with same-day LED fluorescence microscopy and Xpert full rollout, targeted use of Xpert in presumptive tuberculosis cases with HIV infection, either as an initial diagnostic test or as a follow-on test to microscopy, would produce DALY gains at a higher incremental cost and therefore is dominated in the context of Tanzania. INTERPRETATION: For Tanzania, this integrated modelling approach predicts that full rollout of Xpert is a cost-effective option for tuberculosis diagnosis and has the potential to substantially reduce the national tuberculosis burden. It also estimates the substantial level of funding that will need to be mobilised to translate this into clinical practice. This approach could be adapted and replicated in other developing countries to inform rational health policy formulation.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In North America, tuberculosis incidence is now very low and risk to healthcare workers has fallen. Indeed, recent cohort data question routine annual tuberculosis screening in this context. We compared the cost-effectiveness of three potential strategies for ongoing screening of North American healthcare workers at risk of exposure. The analysis did not evaluate the cost-effectiveness of screening at hiring, and considered only workers with negative baseline tests. METHODS: A decision analysis model simulated a hypothetical cohort of 1000 workers following negative baseline tests, considering duties, tuberculosis exposure, testing and treatment. Two tests were modelled, the tuberculin skin test (TST) and QuantiFERON(R)-TB-Gold In-Tube (QFT). Three screening strategies were compared: (1) annual screening, where workers were tested yearly; (2) targeted screening, where workers with high-risk duties (e.g. respiratory therapy) were tested yearly and other workers only after recognised exposure; and (3) post exposure-only screening, where all workers were tested only after recognised exposure. Workers with high-risk duties had 1{\%} annual risk of infection, while workers with standard patient care duties had 0.3{\%}. In an alternate higher-risk scenario, the corresponding annual risks of infection were 3{\%} and 1{\%}, respectively. We projected costs, morbidity, quality-adjusted survival and mortality over 20 years after hiring. The analysis used the healthcare system perspective and a 3{\%} annual discount rate. RESULTS: Over 20 years, annual screening with TST yielded an expected 2.68 active tuberculosis cases/1000 workers, versus 2.83 for targeted screening and 3.03 for post-exposure screening only. In all cases, annual screening was associated with poorer quality-adjusted survival, i.e. lost quality-adjusted life years, compared to targeted or post-exposure screening only. The annual TST screening strategy yielded an incremental cost estimate of {\$}1,717,539 per additional case prevented versus targeted TST screening, which in turn cost an incremental {\$}426,678 per additional case prevented versus post-exposure TST screening only. With the alternate "higher-risk" scenario, the annual TST strategy cost an estimated {\$}426,678 per additional case prevented versus the targeted TST strategy, which cost an estimated {\$}52,552 per additional case prevented versus post-exposure TST screening only. In all cases, QFT was more expensive than TST, with no or limited added benefit. Sensitivity analysis suggested that, even with limited exposure recognition, annual screening was poorly cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: For most North American healthcare workers, annual tuberculosis screening appears poorly cost-effective. Reconsideration of screening practices is warranted.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most complex, persistent and controversial problems facing the Britis hcattle industry, costing the country an estimated {\pounds}100million per year. The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determin- ing the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientificdebate. In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine TB in Great Britain tha tcombines within-farm and between-farm transmission.At the farm scale the model incorporates stochastic transmissionof infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System.The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfectionfrom an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivityof the diagnostic test all having substantive roles.This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because delay in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) contributes to the spread of disease and the associated mortality risk, the authors examined the effectiveness and cost of recent advances in methods of diagnosing TB and testing for drug susceptibility, comparing these rapid methods to traditional approaches. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to compare newer rapid and older nonrapid methods for diagnosing TB and testing for drug susceptibility. The average time to diagnosis, average time to treatment, average mortality, and cost of caring for patients evaluated for TB were compared. RESULTS: Using a combination of solid medium and broth cultures, nucleic acid probes for identification, and radiometric broth drug susceptibility testing would lead to diagnosis on average 15 days faster and to appropriate therapy on average five days sooner than methods currently employed by many U.S. laboratories. The average mortality would drop by five patients per 1000 patients evaluated (31{\%}) and the average cost per patient would drop by {\$}272 (18{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In this era of cost containment, it is important to incorporate test sensitivity and specificity when evaluating technologies. Tests with higher unit costs may lead to lower medical expenditures when diagnostic accuracy and speed are improved. U.S. laboratories should employ available rapid techniques for the diagnosis of TB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy sets global targets of reducing tuberculosis incidence by 50{\%} and mortality by 75{\%} by 2025. We aimed to assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness of strategies to achieve these targets in China, India, and South Africa. METHODS: We examined intervention scenarios developed in consultation with country stakeholders, which scaled up existing interventions to high but feasible coverage by 2025. Nine independent modelling groups collaborated to estimate policy outcomes, and we estimated the cost of each scenario by synthesising service use estimates, empirical cost data, and expert opinion on implementation strategies. We estimated health effects (ie, disability-adjusted life-years averted) and resource implications for 2016-35, including patient-incurred costs. To assess resource requirements and cost-effectiveness, we compared scenarios with a base case representing continued current practice. FINDINGS: Incremental tuberculosis service costs differed by scenario and country, and in some cases they more than doubled existing funding needs. In general, expansion of tuberculosis services substantially reduced patient-incurred costs and, in India and China, produced net cost savings for most interventions under a societal perspective. In all three countries, expansion of access to care produced substantial health gains. Compared with current practice and conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds, most intervention approaches seemed highly cost-effective. INTERPRETATION: Expansion of tuberculosis services seems cost-effective for high-burden countries and could generate substantial health and economic benefits for patients, although substantial new funding would be required. Further work to determine the optimal intervention mix for each country is necessary. FUNDING: Bill {\&} Melinda Gates Foundation.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to characterize the risk of infection from airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli exposure in commercial passenger trains based on a risk-based probabilistic transmission modeling. We investigated the tuberculosis (TB) infection risks among commercial passengers by inhaled aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli and quantify the patterns of TB transmission in Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR). A deterministic Wells-Riley mathematical model was used to account for the probability of infection risk from M. tuberculosis bacilli by linking the cough-generated aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli concentration and particle size distribution. We found that (i) the quantum generation rate of TB was estimated with a lognormal distribution of geometric mean (GM) of 54.29 and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.05 quantum/h at particle size {\textless}/= 5 mum and (ii) the basic reproduction numbers (R(0) ) were estimated to be 0.69 (0.06-6.79), 2.82 (0.32-20.97), and 2.31 (0.25-17.69) for business, standard, and nonreserved cabins, respectively. The results indicate that commercial passengers taking standard and nonreserved cabins had higher transmission risk than those in business cabins based on conservatism. Our results also reveal that even a brief exposure, as in the bronchoscopy cases, can also result in a transmission when the quantum generation rate is high. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of TB transmission in commercial passenger trains by assessing the relationship between TB infectiousness, passenger mobility, and key model parameters such as seat occupancy, ventilation rate, and exposure duration.},

abstract = {When replicate count data are overdispersed, it is common practice to incorporate this extra-Poisson variability by including latent parameters at the observation level. For example, the negative binomial and Poisson-lognormal (PLN) models are obtained by using gamma and lognormal latent parameters, respectively. Several recent publications have employed the deviance information criterion (DIC) to choose between these two models, with the deviance defined using the Poisson likelihood that is obtained from conditioning on these latent parameters. The results herein show that this use of DIC is inappropriate. Instead, DIC was seen to perform well if calculated using likelihood that was marginalized at the group level by integrating out the observation-level latent parameters. This group-level marginalization is explicit in the case of the negative binomial, but requires numerical integration for the PLN model. Similarly, DIC performed well to judge whether zero inflation was required when calculated using the group-marginalized form of the zero-inflated likelihood. In the context of comparing multilevel hierarchical models, the top-level DIC was obtained using likelihood that was further marginalized by additional integration over the group-level latent parameters, and the marginal densities of the models were calculated for the purpose of providing Bayes' factors. The computational viability and interpretability of these different measures is considered.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of an incentive-based tuberculosis (TB) program designed to promote adolescents' compliance with treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Adolescents between the ages of 11 and 19 years who were referred to one of two participating clinics after being screened for TB and receiving a positive diagnosis indicating LTBI (n = 794) were assigned to one of four groups: usual care, peer counseling, contingency contracting, and combined peer counseling/contingency contracting. Primary outcome variables were completion of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), total treatment costs, and lifetime TB-related costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in each of the four study groups (three treatment, one control). Cost effectiveness was evaluated using a five-stage Markov model and a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials. RESULTS: Average costs were 199 dollars for usual care (UC), 277 dollars for peer counseling (PC), 326 dollars for contingency contracting (CC), and 341 dollars for PC + CC combined. The differences among these groups were all significant at the p = .001 level. Only the PC + CC group improved the rate of IPT completion (83.8{\%}) relative to usual care (75.9{\%}) (p = .051), with an overall incremental CE ratio of 209 dollars per QALY relative to usual care. CONCLUSION: Incentives combined with peer counseling are a cost-effective strategy for helping adolescents to complete care when combined with peer counseling.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: A 4-month first-line treatment regimen for tuberculosis disease (TB) is expected to have a direct impact on patient outcomes and societal costs, as well as an indirect impact on Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission. We aimed to estimate this combined impact in a high TB-burden country: South Africa. METHOD: An individual based M. tb transmission model was fitted to the TB burden of South Africa using a standard TB natural history framework. We measured the impact on TB burden from 2015-2035 of introduction of a non-inferior 4-month regimen replacing the standard 6-month regimen as first-line therapy. Impact was measured with respect to three separate baselines (Guidelines, Policy and Current), reflecting differences in adherence to TB and HIV treatment guidelines. Further scenario analyses considered the variation in treatment-related parameters and resistance levels. Impact was measured in terms of differences in TB burden and Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) averted. We also examined the highest cost at which the new regimen would be cost-effective for several willingness-to-pay thresholds. RESULTS: It was estimated that a 4-month regimen would avert less than 1{\%} of the predicted 6 million person years with TB disease in South Africa between 2015 and 2035. A similarly small impact was seen on deaths and DALYs averted. Despite this small impact, with the health systems and patient cost savings from regimen shortening, the 4-month regimen could be cost-effective at {\$}436 [NA, 5983] (mean [range]) per month at a willingness-to-pay threshold of one GDP per capita ({\$}6,618). CONCLUSION: The introduction of a non-inferior 4-month first-line TB regimen into South Africa would have little impact on the TB burden. However, under several scenarios, it is likely that the averted societal costs would make such a regimen cost-effective in South Africa.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) using a commercially available detection test and treating individuals at high risk for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a middle-income country. DESIGN: We developed a Markov model to evaluate the cost per LTBI case detected, TB case averted and quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained for a cohort of 1000 individuals at high risk for HIV infection over 20 years. Baseline model inputs for LTBI prevalence were obtained from published literature and cross-sectional data from tuberculosis (TB) screening using QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFT-GIT) testing among sex workers and illicit drug users at high risk for HIV recruited through street outreach in Tijuana, Mexico. Costs are reported in 2007 US dollars. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3{\%} per year. Sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate model robustness. RESULTS: Over 20 years, we estimate the program would prevent 78 cases of active TB and 55 TB-related deaths. The incremental cost per case of LTBI detected was US{\$}730, cost per active TB averted was US{\$}529 and cost per QALY gained was US{\$}108. CONCLUSIONS: In settings of endemic TB and escalating HIV incidence, targeting LTBI screening and treatment among high-risk groups may be highly cost-effective.},

abstract = {A key issue for the study of tuberculosis infection (TB) is to understand why individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis experience different clinical outcomes. Elaborating the immune mechanisms that determine whether an infected individual will suffer active TB or latent infection can aid in developing treatment and prevention strategies. To better understand the dynamics of M. tuberculosis infection and immunity, we have developed a virtual human model that qualitatively and quantitatively characterizes the cellular and cytokine control network operational during TB infection. Using this model, we identify key regulatory elements in the host response. In particular, factors affecting cell functions, such as macrophage activation and bactericidal capabilities, and effector T cell functions such as cytotoxicity and cytokine production can each be determinative. The model indicates, however, that even if latency is achieved, it may come at the expense of tissue damage if the response is not properly regulated. A balance in Th1 and Th2 immune responses governed by IFN-gamma, IL-10, and IL-4 facilitate this down-regulation. These results are further explored through virtual deletion and depletion experiments.},

While antibiotic resistance is cited as a potential threat to efforts aimed at controlling the spread of this pathogen, it is not clear how drug resistance affects disease dynamics. The effect of mutational events that lead to antibiotic-resistant phenotypes may or may not have a predictable effect on the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Here, we review the literature on laboratory studies of the fitness of drug-resistant tuberculosis, we examine the evidence from cluster studies, and we consider the effect of drug resistance on disease dynamics in mathematical models. On the basis of these diverse lines of evidence, we conclude that the fitness estimates of drug-resistant M tuberculosis are quite heterogeneous and that this variation may preclude our ability to predict future trends of this pathogen.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major public health challenge. China accounts for more than 10{\%} of the global TB burden, and effective modelling of TB trends remains limited. METHODS: We used data drawn primarily from two Chinese nation-wide cross-sectional epidemiological surveys combined with data from China's National Disease Reporting Network to construct an eight-state Markov model that simulates TB prevalence. By adjusting the relevant parameters, we evaluated which characteristics have the greatest bearing upon prevalence and efficacy of the response measures. RESULTS: If current trends continue, the prevalence of TB in China will enter an 8-year period of decline from approximately 390 to 200 cases per 100 000 population and stabilize at 163 cases per 100 000 population, which is a figure well above the World Health Organization (WHO) goal of eliminating TB by 2050. We find that the proportion of notified cases in the population, the rate of progression from latent to active and the overall treatment success rate are the chief factors affecting disease progression. CONCLUSION: We suggest a 90-90-90 strategy, wherein the proportion of notified cases in the population reaches 90{\%}, the risk of progression from latent to active is decreased by 90{\%} compared with the current level and the overall treatment success rate is increased to 90{\%}. This strategy could reduce TB prevalence to less than 10 cases per 100 000 population within 5 years and to 1.77 cases per 100 000 population within 50 years.},

abstract = {The decrease in overall incidence of TB in industrialised countries, together with the increasing concern for adverse events following BCG immunization, has led to important modifications of BCG policies in the last decades. This article adapts and validates - with surveillance data - a theoretical model estimating the impact of different national BCG vaccination policies on severe childhood TB in low to intermediate TB prevalent countries. The model shows that a universal BCG programme could be beneficial in settings with prevalence levels around 30 sputum smear positive per 100,000. In settings with prevalence levels below 15 per 100,000 the benefit of universal BCG vaccination should be carefully assessed, particularly where prevalence is below 5 per 100,000 and universal vaccination might lead to an excess of adverse events per case prevented. To this purpose the model also provides a tool to assess the theoretical impact of a policy change towards selective 'high-risk groups' vaccination. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Detractors of BCG point to its uncertain effectiveness and its interference with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). In order to quantify the trade-off between vaccination and treatment of LTBI, a mathematical model was designed and calibrated to data from Brazil, Ghana; Germany, India, Mexico, Romania, the United Kingdom and the United States. Country-specific thresholds for when LTBI treatment outperforms mass vaccination were found and the consequences of policy changes were estimated. Our results suggest that vaccination outperforms LTBI treatment in all settings but with greatly reduced efficiency in low incidence countries. While national policy statements emphasize BCG's interference with LTBI detection, we find that reinfection should be more determinant of a country's proper policy choice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Implementation of the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course therapy) can result in significant reduction in tuberculosis incidence. We estimated potential costs and benefits of DOTS expansion in Haiti from the government, and societal perspectives. METHODS: Using decision analysis incorporating multiple Markov processes (Markov modelling), we compared expected tuberculosis morbidity, mortality and costs in Haiti with DOTS expansion to reach all of the country, and achieve WHO benchmarks, or if the current situation did not change. Probabilities of tuberculosis related outcomes were derived from the published literature. Government health expenditures, patient and family costs were measured in direct surveys in Haiti and expressed in 2003 US{\$}. RESULTS: Starting in 2003, DOTS expansion in Haiti is anticipated to cost {\$}4.2 million and result in 63,080 fewer tuberculosis cases, 53,120 fewer tuberculosis deaths, and net societal savings of {\$}131 million, over 20 years. Current government spending for tuberculosis is high, relative to the per capita income, and would be only slightly lower with DOTS. Societal savings would begin within 4 years, and would be substantial in all scenarios considered, including higher HIV seroprevalence or drug resistance, unchanged incidence following DOTS expansion, or doubling of initial and ongoing costs for DOTS expansion. CONCLUSION: A modest investment for DOTS expansion in Haiti would provide considerable humanitarian benefit by reducing tuberculosis-related morbidity, mortality and costs for patients and their families. These benefits, together with projected minimal Haitian government savings, argue strongly for donor support for DOTS expansion.},

abstract = {We present a mathematical model to simulate tuberculosis (TB) transmission in highly endemic regions of the Asia-Pacific, where epidemiology does not appear to be primarily driven by HIV-coinfection. The ten-compartment deterministic model captures many of the observed phenomena important to disease dynamics, including partial and temporary vaccine efficacy, declining risk of active disease following infection, the possibility of reinfection both during the infection latent period and after treatment, multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and de novo resistance during treatment. We found that the model could not be calibrated to the estimated incidence rate without allowing for reinfection during latency, and that even in the presence of a moderate fitness cost and a lower value of R0, MDR-TB becomes the dominant strain at equilibrium. Of the modifiable programmatic parameters, the rate of detection and treatment commencement was the most important determinant of disease rates with each respective strain, while vaccination rates were less important. Improved treatment of drug-susceptible TB did not result in decreased rates of MDR-TB through prevention of de novo resistance, but rather resulted in a modest increase in MDR-TB through strain replacement. This was due to the considerably greater relative contribution of community transmission to MDR-TB incidence, by comparison to de novo amplification of resistance in previously susceptible strains. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: According to the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, new active tuberculosis (TB) cases have increased since 2001. Some key factors explain and characterize the transmission dynamics of Korean TB infection, such as a higher ratio of latent individuals and a new reporting system implemented in 2001, among others. METHODS: We propose a mathematical TB model that includes exogenous reinfection to gain a better understanding of the recent trend for TB incidence. We divide the simulation time window into two periods, 1970-2000 and 2001-2012, according to the implementation date of a new TB detection system. RESULTS: Two sets of parameters, including the transmission rate, the latent period, the recovery rate, and the proportion of exogenous reinfection, are estimated using the least-squares method and calibrated to data on the incidence of active TB. CONCLUSION: Among some key parameters in the model, the case finding effort turned out to be the most significant impacting component on the reduction in the active TB cases.},

@article{Tanaka2004,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: While the pathogenesis and epidemiology of tuberculosis are well studied, relatively little is known about the evolution of the infectious agent Mycobacterium tuberculosis, especially at the within-host level. The insertion sequence IS6110 is a genetic marker that is widely used to track the transmission of tuberculosis between individuals. This and other markers may also facilitate our understanding of the disease within patients. RESULTS: This article presents three lines of evidence supporting the action of positive selection on M. tuberculosis within patients. The arguments are based on a comparison between empirical findings from molecular epidemiology, and population genetic models of evolution. Under the hypothesis of neutrality of genotypes, 1) the mutation rate of the marker IS6110 is unusually high, 2) the time it takes for substitutions to occur within patients is too short, and 3) the amount of polymorphism within patients is too low. CONCLUSIONS: Empirical observations are explained by the action of positive selection during infection, or alternatively by very low effective population sizes. I discuss the possible roles of antibiotic treatment, the host immune system and extrapulmonary dissemination in creating opportunities for positive selection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The increasing global burden of tuberculosis (TB) is linked to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: We reviewed data from notifications of TB cases, cohort treatment outcomes, surveys of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and HIV prevalence in patients with TB and other subgroups. Information was collated from published literature and databases held by the World Health Organization (WHO), the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (UNAIDS), the US Census Bureau, and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. RESULTS: There were an estimated 8.3 million (5th-95th centiles, 7.3-9.2 million) new TB cases in 2000 (137/100,000 population; range, 121/100,000-151/100,000). Tuberculosis incidence rates were highest in the WHO African Region (290/100,000 per year; range, 265/100,000-331/100,000), as was the annual rate of increase in the number of cases (6{\%}). Nine percent (7{\%}-12{\%}) of all new TB cases in adults (aged 15-49 years) were attributable to HIV infection, but the proportion was much greater in the WHO African Region (31{\%}) and some industrialized countries, notably the United States (26{\%}). There were an estimated 1.8 million (5th-95th centiles, 1.6-2.2 million) deaths from TB, of which 12{\%} (226 000) were attributable to HIV. Tuberculosis was the cause of 11{\%} of all adult AIDS deaths. The prevalence of M tuberculosis-HIV coinfection in adults was 0.36{\%} (11 million people). Coinfection prevalence rates equaled or exceeded 5{\%} in 8 African countries. In South Africa alone there were 2 million coinfected adults. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV pandemic presents a massive challenge to global TB control. The prevention of HIV and TB, the extension of WHO DOTS programs, and a focused effort to control HIV-related TB in areas of high HIV prevalence are matters of great urgency.},

This strongly suggests that the two theories actually are equivalent. As further evidence in the same direction, we show that the Dirichlet one-brane of Type I string theory has the same world-sheet structure as the heterotic string.},

A manual search of immunisation records determined overall rates and the rates for infants belonging to various ethnic groups.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of 5308 infants born in 2003, 514 (9.6{\%}) were at risk of TB; 423 (82.2{\%}) of these infants were referred postnatally for BCG vaccination and 391 received it. Twenty six of the 41 at risk white British infants missed having a BCG vaccination compared with 47 of 288 Asian infants and seven of 39 black African babies.

abstract = {The pacific islands of Micronesia have experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past decade. Since these outbreaks occurred in confined island populations, their analysis can improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the pathogens involved, and particularly so for yet understudied pathogens such as Zika virus. Here, we compare three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks. We found that the estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue are similar when considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for the same disease can vary considerably by setting. On the Yap Main Islands, we estimate a mean reproduction number of 4.3 (95{\%} credible interval 3.1-6.1) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8 (2.9-8.1) for the Zika outbreak, whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our mean estimate is 10 (5.5-18). We further found that the ranges of most disease-specific parameters largely overlap between dengue and Zika, but that reporting rates of Zika cases are much smaller (3{\%}, 1-7) than those of dengue (68{\%}, 43-98). These results suggests that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when extrapolating findings from one setting to another. Field studies on differences in vector density and biting exposure, as well as comparative modelling studies in other settings, could yield important further insights into the relationship between the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue, and the specific setting in which they occur.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In India as elsewhere, multi-drug resistance (MDR) poses a serious challenge in the control of tuberculosis (TB). The End TB strategy, recently approved by the world health assembly, aims to reduce TB deaths by 95{\%} and new cases by 90{\%} between 2015 and 2035. A key pillar of this approach is early diagnosis of tuberculosis, including use of higher-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal rapid drug susceptibility testing (DST). Despite limitations of current laboratory assays, universal access to rapid DST could become more feasible with the advent of new and emerging technologies. Here we use a mathematical model of TB transmission, calibrated to the TB epidemic in India, to explore the potential impact of a major national scale-up of rapid DST. To inform key parameters in a clinical setting, we take GeneXpert as an example of a technology that could enable such scale-up. We draw from a recent multi-centric demonstration study conducted in India that involved upfront Xpert MTB/RIF testing of all TB suspects. RESULTS: We find that widespread, public-sector deployment of high-sensitivity diagnostic testing and universal DST appropriately linked with treatment could substantially impact MDR-TB in India. Achieving 75{\%} access over 3 years amongst all cases being diagnosed for TB in the public sector alone could avert over 180,000 cases of MDR-TB (95{\%} CI 44187 - 317077 cases) between 2015 and 2025. Sufficiently wide deployment of Xpert could, moreover, turn an increasing MDR epidemic into a diminishing one. Synergistic effects were observed with assumptions of simultaneously improving MDR-TB treatment outcomes. Our results illustrate the potential impact of new and emerging technologies that enable widespread, timely DST, and the important effect that universal rapid DST in the public sector can have on the MDR-TB epidemic in India.},

The finding of a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on the treatment of pulmonary TB is important for TB control and vaccination programmes.},

For simplicity, the main description is restricted to dichotomous variables and assumes that no random error attributable to sampling variability exists. The appendix provides a discussion of sampling variability and a generalisation of this causal theory. The difference between association and causation is described-the redundant expression "causal effect" is used throughout the article to avoid confusion with a common use of "effect" meaning simply statistical association-and shows why, in theory, randomisation allows the estimation of causal effects without further assumptions. The article concludes with a discussion on the limitations of randomised studies. These limitations are the reason why methods for causal inference from observational data are needed.},

@article{Vynnycky1998b,
abstract = {The net and basic reproduction numbers are among the most widely-applied concepts in infectious disease epidemiology. A net reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases resulting from each case in a given population) of above 1 is conventionally associated with an increase in incidence; the basic reproduction number (defined analogously for a 'totally susceptible' population) provides a standard measure of the 'transmission potential' of an infection. Using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1900, we demonstrate that these measures are difficult to apply if disease can follow reinfection, and that they lose their conventional interpretations if important epidemiological parameters, such as the rate of contact between individuals, change over the time interval between successive cases in a chain of transmission (the serial interval). The net reproduction number for tuberculosis in England and Wales appears to have been approximately 1 from 1900 until 1950, despite concurrent declines in morbidity and mortality rates, and it declined rapidly in the second half of this century. The basic reproduction number declined from about 3 in 1900, reached 2 by 1950, and first fell below 1 in about 1960. Reductions in effective contact between individuals over this period, measured in terms of the average number of individuals to whom each case could transmit the infection, meant that the conventional basic reproduction number measure (which does not consider subsequent changes in epidemiological parameters) for a given year failed to reflect the 'actual transmission potential' of the infection. This latter property is better described by a variant of the conventional measure which takes secular trends in contact into account. These results are relevant for the interpretation of trends in any infectious disease for which epidemiological parameters change over time periods comparable to the infectious period, incubation period or serial interval.},

abstract = {String theory is an ambitious project. It purports to be an all-encompassing theory of the universe, unifying the forces of Nature, including gravity, in a single quantum mechanical framework. The premise of string theory is that, at the fundamental level, matter does not consist of point-particles but rather of tiny loops of string. From this slightly absurd beginning, the laws of physics emerge. General relativity, electromagnetism and Yang-Mills gauge theories all appear in a surprising fashion. However, they come with baggage. String theory gives rise to a host of other ingredients, most strikingly extra spatial dimensions of the universe beyond the three that we have observed. The purpose of this course is to understand these statements in detail. These lectures differ from most other courses that you will take in a physics degree. String theory is speculative science. There is no experimental evidence that string theory is the correct description of our world and scant hope that hard evidence will arise in the near future. Moreover, string theory is very much a work in progress and certain aspects of the theory are far from understood. Unresolved issues abound and it seems likely that the final formulation has yet to be written. For these reasons, I'll begin this introduction by suggesting some answers to the question: Why study string theory?},

The host population is divided into five subclasses of susceptibles, latent TB, active TB (without HIV), HIV infectives (without TB), and coinfection class (infected by both TB and HIV). The model exhibits three boundary equilibria, namely, disease free equilibrium, TB dominated equilibrium, and HIV dominated equilibrium. We discuss the local or global stabilities of boundary equilibria. We prove the persistence of our model. Our simple model of two synergistic infectious disease epidemics illustrates the importance of including the effects of each disease on the transmission and progression of the other disease.

However, compliance with skin testing programs has been poor and their cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS: A Markov-based decision analysis was performed to determine the cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin testing over the entire lifetimes of physicians who are now in medical school. Assumptions were deliberately chosen to present a conservative estimate of cost-effectiveness. Indirect costs were not included. RESULTS: Annual testing cost {\$}29,000 per life-year saved and {\$}39,000 per case of pulmonary tuberculosis prevented. In contrast, particulate respirators have been shown to cost millions of dollars per case prevented. Skin testing every 6 months was cost-effective in a subpopulation at high risk of infection ({\textgreater} or = 1.8-fold). During their entire lifetimes, physicians now in medical school can expect to avert 137 cases of pulmonary tuberculosis, prevent 7 tuberculosis deaths, and save 182 life-years because of skin testing programs. Improved compliance with annual skin testing and prophylactic isoniazid could more than triple this benefit. If available, a moderately effective vaccine would be even more cost-effective than tuberculin skin testing programs. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculin skin testing is cost-effective and should be an integral part of any tuberculosis control program. Vaccination may one day be a feasible and cost-effective alternative to skin testing programs.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous studies of interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) and tuberculin skin testing (TST) to assess latent tuberculosis infection have been published without a framework to understand the extent to which these two tests should agree. Analyzing the causes of variability in agreement levels is crucial. METHODS: A mathematical model of agreement between dichotomous tests was used to understand variations in the level of agreement between IGRA and TST results. The effect of cut-off point selection on agreement was also explored using the model. Model-based predictions are illustrated using published literature. RESULTS: Analyses of IGRAs and TST that depart from model predictions are an indication that surrogates of prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection may have been improperly measured or analyzed. For fixed prevalence, the extent of agreement between tests depends upon cut-off point selection. Changing cut-off points while holding prevalence constant may lead to increasing, decreasing or even no change in agreement. CONCLUSIONS: Researchers have recognized that experimental error, clinical risk and prevalence of non-tuberculous mycobacteria contribute to study-to-study variability. In the present study, we show that paradoxical findings in certain IGRA studies can be explained by the proposed mathematical model. Re-analysis of existing studies may lead to overlooked hypotheses. Future IGRA studies will require epidemiologically well-characterized populations.},

In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve. A new and plausible definition of evenness is derived. See full-text article at JSTOR},

abstract = {Background: Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. Methods: A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. Results: The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. Conclusions: Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.},

abstract = {Although annual data are commonly used to model linear trends and changes in trends of disease incidence, monthly data could provide additional resolution for statistical inferences. Because monthly data may exhibit seasonal patterns, we need to consider seasonally adjusted models, which can be theoretically complex and computationally intensive. We propose a combination of methods to reduce the complexity of modeling seasonal data and to provide estimates for a change in trend when the timing and magnitude of the change are unknown. To assess potential changes in trend, we first used autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) models to analyze the residuals and forecast errors, followed by multiple ARIMA intervention models to estimate the timing and magnitude of the change. Because the variable corresponding to time of change is not a statistical parameter, its confidence bounds cannot be estimated by intervention models. To model timing of change and its credible interval, we developed a Bayesian technique. We avoided the need for computationally intensive simulations by deriving a closed form for the posterior distribution of the time of change. Using a combination of ARIMA and Bayesian methods, we estimated the timing and magnitude of change in trend for tuberculosis cases in the United States. Published 2012.

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most complex, persistent and controversial problems facing the Britis hcattle industry, costing the country an estimated {\pounds}100million per year. The low sensitivity of the standard diagnostic test leads to considerable ambiguity in determin- ing the main transmission routes of infection, which exacerbates the continuing scientificdebate. In turn this uncertainty fuels the fierce public and political disputes on the necessity of controlling badgers to limit the spread of infection. Here we present a dynamic stochastic spatial model for bovine TB in Great Britain tha tcombines within-farm and between-farm transmission.At the farm scale the model incorporates stochastic transmissionof infection, maintenance of infection in the environment and testing protocol that mimics historical government policy. Between-farm transmission has a short-range environmental component and is explicitly driven by movements of individual cattle between farms, as recorded in the Cattle Tracing System.The resultant model replicates the observed annual increase of infection over time as well as the spread of infection into new areas. Given that our model is mechanistic, it can ascribe transmission pathways to each new case; the majority of newly detected cases involve several transmission routes with moving infected cattle, reinfectionfrom an environmental reservoir and poor sensitivityof the diagnostic test all having substantive roles.This underpins our findings on the implications of control measures. Very few of the control options tested have the potential to reverse the observed annual increase, with only intensive strategies such as whole-herd culling or additional national testing proving highly effective, whereas controls focused on a single transmission route are unlikely to be highly effective.},

abstract = {Historically, dosing regimens for the treatment of tuberculosis (TB) have been proposed in an empirical manner. Dose selection has often been the result of efficacy trials in which drugs were administered regardless of the magnitude of the effect of demographic factors on drug disposition. This has created challenges for the prescription of fixed-dose combinations with novel therapeutic agents. The objectives of this investigation were to evaluate the impact of body weight on the overall systemic exposure to pyrazinamide (PZA) and to assess whether the use of one fixed dose, without adjustment according to weight, would ensure target exposure and safety requirements across the overall patient population. Using a population pharmacokinetic model, simulation scenarios were explored based on population demographics from clinical trials in TB patients and on historical hepatotoxicity data. The systemic drug exposure (area under the concentration-time curve [AUC]), peak concentrations (the maximum concentration of drug in serum [C(max)]), the time above the MIC (t {\textgreater} MIC), and the risk of hepatotoxicity were evaluated for the current weight-banded regimen and compared to fixed doses under the assumption that pharmacokinetic differences are the primary drivers of toxicity. Evaluation of the standard weight banding reveals that more than 50{\%} of subjects in the weight range of 45 to 55 kg remain below the proposed target exposure to PZA. In contrast, the use of a fixed 1,500-mg dose resulted in a lower proportion of subjects under the target value, with a 0.2{\%} average overall increase in the risk of hepatotoxicity. Our results strongly support the use of a fixed-dose regimen for PZA in coformulation or combination with novel therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Against the backdrop of renewed efforts to control tuberculosis (TB) worldwide, there is a need for improved methods to estimate the public health impact of TB programmes. Such methods should not only address the improved outcomes amongst those receiving care but should also account for the impact of TB services on reducing transmission. METHODS: Vital registration data in India are not sufficiently reliable for estimates of TB mortality. As an alternative approach, we developed a mathematical model of TB transmission dynamics and mortality, capturing the scale-up of DOTS in India, through the rollout of the Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP). We used available data from the literature to calculate TB mortality hazards amongst untreated TB; amongst cases treated under RNTCP; and amongst cases treated under non-RNTCP conditions. Using a Bayesian evidence synthesis framework, we combined these data with current estimates for the TB burden in India to calibrate the transmission model. We simulated the national TB epidemic in the presence and absence of the DOTS programme, measuring lives saved as the difference in TB deaths between these scenarios. RESULTS: From 1997 to 2016, India's RNTCP has saved 7.75 million lives (95{\%} Bayesian credible interval 6.29-8.82 million). We estimate that 42{\%} of this impact was due to the 'indirect' effects of the RNTCP in averting transmission as well as improving treatment outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When expanding high-quality TB services, a substantial proportion of overall impact derives from preventive, as well as curative, benefits. Mathematical models, together with sufficient data, can be a helpful tool in estimating the true population impact of major disease control programmes.},

abstract = {SETTING: Standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is 9 months daily isoniazid (9INH). An alternative is 4 months daily rifampin (4RMP), associated with better completion and less toxicity; however, its efficacy remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To assess the cost-effectiveness of these regimens for treating LTBI in human immunodeficiency virus negative persons, using results from a recent clinical trial, plus different scenarios for 4RMP efficacy, and to estimate the costs of an adequately powered noninferiority trial and resulting savings from substitution with 4RMP. DESIGN: A decision-analysis model tracked TB contacts and lower-risk tuberculin reactors receiving 9INH, 4RMP or no treatment. For different 4RMP efficacy scenarios, we estimated the cost-effectiveness, sample size and cost of non-inferiority trials, and potential cost savings substituting 4RMP for 9INH for 10 years in Canada. RESULTS: With an assumed 4RMP efficacy of 60{\%}, 9INH was more effective but slightly more expensive. Above a threshold efficacy of 69{\%}, 4RMP was cheaper and more effective than 9INH. If the true efficacy of 4RMP is {\textgreater}/=75{\%}, a trial powered to detect non-inferiority with a lower limit of 60{\%} estimated efficacy ({\~{}}20 000 subjects) may lead to cost savings within 10 years, even with the extreme assumption that Canada bears the entire cost. CONCLUSION: 4RMP may be a reasonable alternative to 9INH. Costs of a large-scale non-inferiority trial may be offset by subsequent savings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population decline, arising from below replacement fertility and possibly giving rise to substantial changes in age distribution, is a feature of many industrialized developed countries; Italy is one of the most notable European examples. The potential influence of this phenomenon on prevalence of chronic non-infectious disease is well known, but little attention to date has been paid to the impact on severe disease due to childhood infections in those cases where control is insufficient to achieve elimination. METHODS: A transmission dynamics model incorporating realistic demography is used to investigate the possible impact of population decline and ageing and suboptimal vaccination uptake on the age distribution of incidence of measles infection and of consequent mortality. Data from Italy is used to parameterize the model. RESULTS: Population ageing in the absence of vaccination is shown to reduce per capita incidence of infection but also to increase average and upper quartile ages at infection. The effect is substantially enhanced by significantly suboptimal vaccination uptake, when disease-induced mortality has, for a period, the potential to exceed that in the absence of vaccination. CONCLUSIONS: Although a substantially increased burden from chronic non-infectious disease has frequently been proposed as a consequence of population decline, there is also potential for an increase in morbidity and mortality from measles and other childhood infectious diseases, particularly where vaccine uptake is substantially below the optimum. Rubella is highlighted as a particular cause for concern. This work also has implications for less-developed countries.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Assess the costs and cost-effectiveness of an incentive-based tuberculosis (TB) program designed to promote adolescents' compliance with treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). METHODS: Randomized controlled trial. Adolescents between the ages of 11 and 19 years who were referred to one of two participating clinics after being screened for TB and receiving a positive diagnosis indicating LTBI (n = 794) were assigned to one of four groups: usual care, peer counseling, contingency contracting, and combined peer counseling/contingency contracting. Primary outcome variables were completion of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), total treatment costs, and lifetime TB-related costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in each of the four study groups (three treatment, one control). Cost effectiveness was evaluated using a five-stage Markov model and a Monte Carlo simulation with 10,000 trials. RESULTS: Average costs were 199 dollars for usual care (UC), 277 dollars for peer counseling (PC), 326 dollars for contingency contracting (CC), and 341 dollars for PC + CC combined. The differences among these groups were all significant at the p = .001 level. Only the PC + CC group improved the rate of IPT completion (83.8{\%}) relative to usual care (75.9{\%}) (p = .051), with an overall incremental CE ratio of 209 dollars per QALY relative to usual care. CONCLUSION: Incentives combined with peer counseling are a cost-effective strategy for helping adolescents to complete care when combined with peer counseling.},

Presently, only 2.4{\%} of new migrants are flagged for post-landing surveillance, which may include latent tuberculosis infection screening; no other migrants receive routine latent tuberculosis infection screening. To aid in reducing the tuberculosis burden in new migrants to Canada, we determined the cost-effectiveness of using different latent tuberculosis infection interventions in migrants under post-arrival surveillance and in all new migrants. METHODS: A discrete event simulation model was developed that focused on a Canadian permanent resident cohort after arrival in Canada, utilizing a ten-year time horizon, healthcare system perspective, and 1.5{\%} discount rate. Latent tuberculosis infection interventions were evaluated in the population under surveillance (N = 6100) and the total cohort (N = 260,600). In all evaluations, six different screening and treatment combinations were compared to the base case of tuberculin skin test screening followed by isoniazid treatment only in the population under surveillance. Quality adjusted life years, incident tuberculosis cases, and costs were recorded for each intervention and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated in relation to the base case. RESULTS: In the population under surveillance (N = 6100), using an interferon-gamma release assay followed by rifampin was dominant compared to the base case, preventing 4.90 cases of tuberculosis, a 4.9{\%} reduction, adding 4.0 quality adjusted life years, and saving {\$}353,013 over the ensuing ten-years. Latent tuberculosis infection screening in the total population (N = 260,600) was not cost-effective when compared to the base case, however could potentially prevent 21.8{\%} of incident tuberculosis cases. CONCLUSIONS: Screening new migrants under surveillance with an interferon-gamma release assay and treating with rifampin is cost saving, but will not significantly impact TB incidence. Universal latent tuberculosis infection screening and treatment is cost-prohibitive. Research into using risk factors to target screening post-landing may provide alternate solutions.},

abstract = {Exposure of populations to microbes which share antigens with pathogens can influence the apparent efficacy of vaccines. This may explain the great variation (from below 0 to 80{\%}) observed in protection by Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) against tuberculosis. This paper explores three models for the effect of such heterologous immunity, and demonstrates that: (a) if the immune responses to the microbial antigens in nature and in the vaccines differ qualitatively, there will be no effect on observed efficacy; (b) if the immune responses differ only quantitatively, the observed vaccine efficacy will be reduced, and it will be minimal when vaccine-induced and heterologous protection are of similar magnitude; and (c) if the heterologous exposure can block the vaccine action, then observed efficacy will be reduced and may even appear negative. These results provide important guidance for the interpretation of BCG's utility and for the development and evaluation of new vaccines, in particular against tuberculosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prompt diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a clinical challenge. It may be achieved by a number of tests which have varying accuracies, costs and degrees of invasiveness. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of clinical judgement (empirical), the Roche Cobas amplicor assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (amplicor), acid-fast staining of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BAL), nucleic acid amplification tests of bronchoalveloar lavage specimens for M. tuberculosis (BAL + NAA), computed tomography (CT) and amplicor assay followed by BAL. METHODOLOGY: The range of predictive values of the various strategies were derived from published data and a new study of 441 consecutive adult patients with suspected smear-negative PTB prospectively stratified into three pretest risk groups: low, intermediate and high. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated with a decision tree model (DATA software). RESULTS: The incidence of PTB was 5.7{\%} (4{\%} culture positive) for the whole group, 95{\%} in the high-risk group, 0.9{\%} in the low-risk group and 3.4{\%} in the intermediate-risk group. The sensitivity of the empirical approach was 49{\%} and of the amplicor assay was 44{\%}. Patient outcomes were expressed as life expectancy for the base case of a 58-year-old man with a pretest probability of 5.7{\%}. At this low pretest risk the differences in life expectancies between tests was {\textless} 0.1 years and the empirical approach incurred the lowest cost. Sensitivity analysis at increasing pretest risks showed better life expectancies (approximately 1 years) for CT scan and test combinations than empirical and amplicor for additional costs of US{\$}243-US{\$}309. Bronchoalveolar lavage had the worst overall cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the pretest risk of active PTB was a key determinant of test utility; that the AMPLICOR assay was comparable to clinical judgement; that BAL was the least useful test; and that with increasing risks, CT scan and test combinations performed better. Further studies are needed to better define patients with intermediate risk for PTB and to directly compare the cost-effectiveness of more sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests such as the enhanced Gen Probe, CT scan and test combinations/sequences in these patients.},

Three types of control measures (vaccination, behavior change and anti-TB treatment strategies) are applied with separate rate for children and adults to analyze the solution of the controlled system by using the concept of optimal control theory. It is indicated that vaccination at birth and treatment for both age groups have impact in reducing the value of the reproduction number (R-o) whereas behavior modification does not have any impact on R-o. Pontryagin's Minimum Principle has been used to characterize the optimal level of controls applied on the model. It is shown that the optimal combination strategy of vaccination, behavior change and treatment for the two age groups can help to reduce the disease epidemic with minimum cost of interventions, in shorter possible time.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis ( TB) remains a major cause of mortality in developing countries, and in these countries diabetes prevalence is increasing rapidly. Diabetes increases the risk of TB. Our aim was to assess the potential impact of diabetes as a risk factor for incident pulmonary tuberculosis, using India as an example. Methods: We constructed an epidemiological model using data on tuberculosis incidence, diabetes prevalence, population structure, and relative risk of tuberculosis associated with diabetes. We evaluated the contribution made by diabetes to both tuberculosis incidence, and to the difference between tuberculosis incidence in urban and rural areas. Results: In India in 2000 there were an estimated 20.7 million adults with diabetes, and 900,000 incident adult cases of pulmonary tuberculosis. Our calculations suggest that diabetes accounts for 14.8{\%} ( uncertainty range 7.1{\%} to 23.8{\%}) of pulmonary tuberculosis and 20.2{\%} ( 8.3{\%} to 41.9{\%}) of smear- positive ( i. e. infectious) tuberculosis. We estimate that the increased diabetes prevalence in urban areas is associated with a 15.2{\%} greater smear- positive tuberculosis incidence in urban than rural areas - over a fifth of the estimated total difference. Conclusion: Diabetes makes a substantial contribution to the burden of incident tuberculosis in India, and the association is particularly strong for the infectious form of tuberculosis. The current diabetes epidemic may lead to a resurgence of tuberculosis in endemic regions, especially in urban areas. This potentially carries a risk of global spread with serious implications for tuberculosis control and the achievement of the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.},

abstract = {Statistical inference for mechanistic models of partially observed dynamic systems is an active area of research. Most existing inference methods place substantial restrictions upon the form of models that can be fitted and hence upon the nature of the scientific hypotheses that can be entertained and the data that can be used to evaluate them. In contrast, the so-called plug-and-play methods require only simulations from a model and are thus free of such restrictions. We show the utility of the plug-and-play approach in the context of an investigation of measles transmission dynamics. Our novel methodology enables us to ask and answer questions that previous analyses have been unable to address. Specifically, we demonstrate that plug-and-play methods permit the development of a modelling and inference framework applicable to data from both large and small populations. We thereby obtain novel insights into the nature of heterogeneity in mixing and comment on the importance of including extra-demographic stochasticity as a means of dealing with environmental stochasticity and model misspecification. Our approach is readily applicable to many other epidemiological and ecological systems.},

abstract = {Novel diagnostic tests hold promise for improving tuberculosis (TB) control, but their epidemiologic impact remains uncertain. Using data from the World Health Organization (2011-2012), we developed a transmission model to evaluate the deployment of 3 hypothetical TB diagnostic tests in Southeast Asia under idealized scenarios of implementation. We defined diagnostics by their sensitivity for smear-negative TB and proportion of patients testing positive who initiate therapy ("point-of-care amenability"), with tests of increasing point-of-care amenability having lower sensitivity. Implemented in the public sector (35{\%} of care-seeking attempts), each novel test reduced TB incidence by 7{\%}-9{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range: 4{\%}-13{\%}) and mortality by 20{\%}-22{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range: 14{\%}-27{\%}) after 10 years. If also deployed in the private sector (65{\%} of attempts), these tests reduced incidence by 13{\%}-16{\%}, whereas a perfect test (100{\%} sensitivity and treatment initiation) reduced incidence by 20{\%}. Annually detecting 20{\%} of prevalent TB cases through targeted screening (70{\%} smear-negative sensitivity, 85{\%} treatment initiation) also reduced incidence by 19{\%}. Sensitivity and point-of-care amenability are equally important considerations when developing novel diagnostic tests for TB. Novel diagnostics can substantially reduce TB incidence and mortality in Southeast Asia but are unlikely to transform TB control unless they are deployed actively and in the private sector.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT) has been recommended for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected individuals. OBJECTIVE/DESIGN: We used a mathematical model to simulate the benefits and risks of preventive treatment delivered through antiretroviral (ARV) clinics using clinical data from Botswana. RESULTS: Preventive treatment was found to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by at least 12 cases per 100000 population per year versus the scenario without such treatment over a 50-year simulation. Isoniazid (INH) resistant TB was observed to increase by {\textless}1{\%} per year, even when using pessimistic assumptions about resistance emergence. The use of tuberculin skin testing had little impact as a screening procedure, while secondary treatment was observed to nearly double the impact of a preventive treatment program. Regardless of whether or not preventive treatment was implemented, INH-resistant TB rose in the context of increasing HIV prevalence, but was minimally amplified by preventive treatment itself. CONCLUSIONS: IPT programs implemented through ARV clinics may be effective at reducing TB incidence. The resistance contribution of IPT appears unlikely to supersede its overall incidence and mortality benefits.},

Twenty-two patients had infection with atypical mycobacteria and were excluded from analysis, as were children under 16 years. Comparison between the age groups was further restricted to white patients because of a skew distribution of Asian patients towards the younger age range. Ninety-six elderly patients (aged 65 years and older) were compared with 127 younger patients. The distribution of pulmonary and extrathoracic disease was similar as was the incidence of positive bacteriology. Elderly people had more frequent lower-zone and more frequent miliary shadowing, otherwise radiographic features were similar. Elderly people were nearly three times more likely to have reactions to antituberculous drugs, six times more likely to die from tuberculosis and over twenty times more likely than younger patients to have the diagnosis made at autopsy rather than during life.},

abstract = {In the study of complex patterns in biology, mathematical and computational models are emerging as important tools. In addition to experimental approaches, these modeling tools have recently been applied to address open questions regarding host-pathogen interaction dynamics, including the immune response to mycobacterial infection and tuberculous granuloma formation. We present an approach in which a computational model represents the interaction of the Mycobacterium infection with the innate immune system in zebrafish at a high level of abstraction. We use the Petri Net formalism to model the interaction between the key host elements involved in granuloma formation and infection dissemination. We define a qualitative model for the understanding and description of causal relations in this dynamic process. Complex processes involving cell-cell or cell-bacteria communication can be modeled at smaller scales and incorporated hierarchically into this main model; these are to be included in later elaborations. With the infection mechanism being defined on a higher level, lower-level processes influencing the host-pathogen interaction can be identified, modeled, and tested both quantitatively and qualitatively. This systems biology framework incorporates modeling to generate and test hypotheses, to perform virtual experiments, and to make experimentally verifiable predictions. Thereby it supports the unraveling of the mechanisms of tuberculosis infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Hong Kong is an affluent subtropical city with a well-developed healthcare infrastructure but an intermediate TB burden. Declines in notification rates through the 1960s and 1970s have slowed since the 1980s to the current level of around 82 cases per 100 000 population. We studied the transmission dynamics of TB in Hong Kong to explore the factors underlying recent trends in incidence. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We fitted an age-structured compartmental model to TB notifications in Hong Kong between 1968 and 2008. We used the model to quantify the proportion of annual cases due to recent transmission versus endogenous reactivation of latent infection, and to project trends in incidence rates to 2018. The proportion of annual TB notifications attributed to endogenous reactivation increased from 46{\%} to 70{\%} between 1968 and 2008. Age-standardized notification rates were projected to decline to approximately 56 per 100 000 in 2018. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Continued intermediate incidence of TB in Hong Kong is driven primarily by endogenous reactivation of latent infections. Public health interventions which focus on reducing transmission may not lead to substantial reductions in disease burden associated with endogenous reactivation of latent infections in the short- to medium-term. While reductions in transmission with socio-economic development and public health interventions will lead to declines in TB incidence in these regions, a high prevalence of latent infections may hinder substantial declines in burden in the longer term. These findings may therefore have important implications for the burden of TB in developing regions with higher levels of transmission currently.},

(J Theor Biol 247, 765-774, 2007) examined two mathematical models (delay differential equation and network models) that explored the role of the contact structure of the population and found that in declining epidemics, localized outbreaks may occur as a result of contact heterogeneities even in the absence of host or strain variability. In this work, we carry out several qualitative studies (including the use of Sturm sequences for obtaining conditions on bifurcations) on the differential equation model with a time delay in Ref. Colijn et al., J Theor Biol 247, 765-774 (2007), and explicitly obtain threshold conditions for disease eradication as well as existence of bifurcations depending on a critical delay value which characterize the duration of fast latency. Further analysis showed the existence of a transcritical bifurcation when the reproduction number was less than one with the disease-free equilibrium co-existing with just one endemic state that was shown to be stable; the period of fast latency and the reinfection progression rate were shown to be very significant in the dynamics of the disease viz a viz the individuals who progressed to active TB within 5 years of their infection.},

abstract = {HIV has fuelled increasing tuberculosis (TB) incidence in sub-Saharan Africa. Better control of TB in this region may be achieved directly through TB programme improvements and indirectly through expanded use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) among those with HIV. We used a mathematical model of TB and HIV in South Africa to examine the potential epidemiological impact in scenarios involving improvements in three dimensions of TB programmes: coverage, diagnosis and treatment effectiveness, as well as expanded ART use through broadened eligibility. We projected the effect of alternative scenarios on TB prevalence, incidence and TB-related mortality over 20 years. Of the three dimensions of TB programme improvement, expanding coverage would produce the greatest reduction in TB burden. Compared with current performance, combined TB programme improvements were projected to decrease TB incidence by 30{\%} over 5 years and 46{\%} over 20 years, and decrease TB-related mortality by 45{\%} over 5 years and 69{\%} over 20 years. Expanded ART eligibility was projected to decrease TB incidence by 22{\%} over 5 years and 45{\%} over 20 years, and TB-related mortality by 22{\%} over 5 years and 50{\%} over 20 years. We found that over a 20-year horizon, TB-specific and HIV-specific programme changes contribute equally to incidence reductions, whereas the TB-specific changes produce a majority of the mortality benefits. An aggressive expansion of ART alongside traditional TB-specific control measures has the potential to greatly reduce TB burden, with the different elements of a combined approach having a synergistic effect in reducing long-term TB incidence and mortality.},

This strongly suggests that the two theories actually are equivalent. As further evidence in the same direction, we show that the Dirichlet one-brane of Type I string theory has the same world-sheet structure as the heterotic string.},

abstract = {An adverse health impact is often treated as a binary variable (response vs. no response), in which case the risk of response is defined as a monotonically increasing function R of the dose received D. For a population of size N, specifying the forms of R(D) and of the probability density function (pdf) for D allows determination of the pdf for risk, and computation of the mean and variance of the distribution of incidence, where the latter parameters are denoted E[SN] and Var[SN], respectively. The distribution of SN describes uncertainty in the future incidence value. Given variability in dose (and risk) among population members, the distribution of incidence is Poisson-binomial. However, depending on the value of E[SN], the distribution of incidence is adequately approximated by a Poisson distribution with parameter mu = E[SN], or by a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to E[SN] and Var[SN]. The general analytical framework is applied to occupational infection by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb). Tuberculosis is transmitted by inhalation of 1-5 microns particles carrying viable M. tb bacilli. Infection risk has traditionally been modeled by the expression: R(D) = 1 - exp(-D), where D is the expected number of bacilli that deposit in the pulmonary region. This model assumes that the infectious dose is one bacillus. The beta pdf and the gamma pdf are shown to be reasonable and especially convenient forms for modeling the distribution of the expected cumulative dose across a large healthcare worker cohort. Use of the the analytical framework is illustrated by estimating the efficacy of different respiratory protective devices in reducing healthcare worker infection risk.},

abstract = {Cytology-based screening has reduced cervical cancer mortality in countries able to implement, sustain and financially support organized programs that achieve broad coverage. These ongoing secondary prevention efforts considerably complicate the question of whether vaccination against human papillomavirus (HPV) types 16 and 18 should be introduced. Policy questions focus primarily on the target ages of vaccination, appropriate ages for a temporary "catch-up" program, possible revisions in screening policies to optimize synergies with vaccination, including the increased used of HPV DNA testing, and the inclusion of boys in the vaccination program. Decision-analytic models are increasingly being developed to simulate disease burden and interventions in different settings in order to evaluate the benefits and cost-effectiveness of primary and secondary interventions for informed decision-making. This article is a focused review on existing mathematical models that have been used to evaluate HPV vaccination in the context of developed countries with existing screening programs. Despite variations in model assumptions and uncertainty in existing data, pre-adolescent vaccination of girls has been consistently found to be attractive in the context of current screening practices, provided there is complete and lifelong vaccine protection and widespread vaccination coverage. Questions related to catch-up vaccination programs, potential benefits of other non-cervical cancer outcomes and inclusion of boys are subject to far more uncertainty, and results from these analyses have reached conflicting conclusions. Most analyses find that some catch-up vaccination is warranted but becomes increasingly unattractive as the catch-up age is extended, and vaccination of boys is unlikely to be cost-effective if reasonable levels of coverage are achieved in girls or coverage among girls can be improved. The objective of this review is to highlight points of consensus and qualitative themes, to discuss the areas of divergent findings, and to provide insight into critical decisions related to cervical cancer prevention. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Neutral models of community dynamics are a powerful tool for ecological research, but their applications are currently limited to unrealistically simple types of dynamics and ignore much of the complexity that characterize natural ecosystems. Here, we present a new analytical framework for neutral models that unifies existing models of neutral communities and extends the applicability of existing models to a much wider spectrum of ecological phenomena. The new framework extends the concept of neutrality to fitness equivalence and in spite of its simplicity explains a wide spectrum of empirical patterns of species diversity including positive, negative and unimodal productivity-diversity relationships; gradual and highly delayed declines in species diversity with habitat loss; and positive and negative responses of species diversity to habitat heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the abundance distribution in all of these cases is given by the dispersal limited multinomial (DLM), the abundance distribution in Hubbell's zero-sum model, showing DLM's robustness and demonstrating that it cannot be used to infer the underlying community dynamics. These results support the hypothesis that ecological communities are regulated by a limited set of fundamental mechanisms much simpler than could be expected from their immense complexity.},

Castillo-Chavez and Feng's model was then subsequently developed by Jung et al. (2002) by adding two control variables. In this work, Jung et al.'s model was modified by introducing a new control variable so that there are three controls, namely chemoprophylaxis and two treatment strategies, with the application of three different scenarios related to the objective functional form and control application. Pontryagin maximum principle was applied to derive the differential equations system as a condition that must be satisfied by the optimal control variables. Furthermore, the fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was exploited to determine the numerical solution of the optimal control problem. In this numerical solution, it is shown that the controls treated on TB transmission model provide a good effect because latent and infected individuals are decreasing, and the number of individuals that is treated effectively is increasing.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally 3.9{\%} of new and 21{\%} of re-treatment tuberculosis (TB) cases are multidrug-resistant or rifampicin-resistant (MDR/RR), which is often interpreted as evidence that drug resistance results mainly from poor treatment adherence. This study aims to assess the respective contributions of the different causal pathways leading to MDR/RR-TB at re-treatment. METHODS: We use a simple mathematical model to simulate progression between the different stages of disease and treatment for patients diagnosed with TB. The model is parameterised using region and country-specific TB disease burden data reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). The contributions of four separate causal pathways to MDR/RR-TB among re-treatment cases are estimated: I) initial drug-susceptible TB with resistance amplification during treatment; II) initial MDR/RR-TB inappropriately treated as drug-susceptible TB; III) MDR/RR-TB relapse despite appropriate treatment; and IV) re-infection with MDR/RR-TB. RESULTS: At the global level, Pathways I, II, III and IV contribute 38{\%} (28-49, 95{\%} Simulation Interval), 44{\%} (36-52, 95{\%} SI), 6{\%} (5-7, 95{\%} SI) and 12{\%} (7-19, 95{\%} SI) respectively to the burden of MDR/RR-TB among re-treatment cases. Pathway II is dominant in the Western Pacific (74{\%}; 67-80 95{\%} SI), Eastern Mediterranean (68{\%}; 60-74 95{\%} SI) and European (53{\%}; 48-59 95{\%} SI) regions, while Pathway I makes the greatest contribution in the American (53{\%}; 40-66 95{\%} SI), African (43{\%}; 28-61 95{\%} SI) and South-East Asian (50{\%}; 40-59 95{\%} SI) regions. CONCLUSIONS: Globally, failure to diagnose MDR/RR-TB at first presentation is the leading cause of the high proportion of MDR/RR-TB among re-treatment cases. These findings highlight the need for contextualised solutions to limit the impact and spread of MDR/RR-TB.},

The estimated overall risk ratio was 0.81 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.71 to 0.92), indicating a protective efficacy of 19{\%} against infection among vaccinated children after exposure compared with unvaccinated children. The observed protection was similar when estimated with the two types of interferon $\gamma$ release assays (ELISpot or QuantiFERON). Restriction of the analysis to the six studies (n=1745) with information on progression to active tuberculosis at the time of screening showed protection against infection of 27{\%} (risk ratio 0.73, 0.61 to 0.87) compared with 71{\%} (0.29, 0.15 to 0.58) against active tuberculosis.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death in South Africa. A number of potential new TB vaccine candidates have been identified and are currently in clinical trials. One such candidate is MVA85A. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding the MVA85A vaccine as a booster to the BCG vaccine in children from the perspective of the South African government. METHODS: The cost-effectiveness was assessed by employing Decision Analytic Modelling, through the use of a Markov model. The model compared the existing strategy of BCG vaccination to a new strategy in which infants receive BCG and a booster vaccine, MVA85A, at 4 months of age. The costs and outcomes of the two strategies are estimated through modelling the vaccination of a hypothetical cohort of newborns and following them from birth through to 10 years of age, employing 6-monthly cycles. RESULTS: The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that the MVA85A strategy is both more costly and more effective - there are fewer TB cases and deaths from TB than BCG alone. The South African government would need to spend an additional USD 1,105 for every additional TB case averted and USD 284,017 for every additional TB death averted. The threshold analysis shows that, if the efficacy of the MVA85A vaccine was 41.3{\%} (instead of the current efficacy of 17.3{\%}), the two strategies would have the same cost but more cases of TB and more deaths from TB would be prevented by adding the MVA85A vaccine to the BCG vaccine. In this case, the government chould consider the MVA85A strategy. CONCLUSIONS: At the current level of efficacy, the MVA85A vaccine is neither effective nor cost-effective and, therefore, not a good use of limited resources. Nevertheless, this study contributes to developing a standardized Markov model, which could be used, in the future, to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of new TB vaccines compared to the BCG vaccine, in children between the ages of 0-10 years. It also provides an indicative threshold of vaccine efficacy, which could guide future development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dramatic decline in tuberculosis (TB) in developed countries during the past century has been attributed to many factors, including improvements in living and social conditions and, more recently, effective treatment. Each of these changes should have reduced the average number of individuals 'effectively contacted' (i.e. sufficiently to transmit infection) by each infectious TB case. METHOD: Estimates of the average number of individuals effectively contacted by each infectious TB case, for each year since 1900 in England and Wales, are derived as the ratio between published estimates of the annual risk of infection and estimates of the prevalence of infectious cases, as derived using a published model of the epidemiology of TB. RESULTS: The results suggest that each infectious case contacted, on average, about 22 individuals in 1900 sufficiently to transmit Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and that this number declined to about 10 by 1950 and to approximately one by 1990. CONCLUSIONS: Although several factors contributed to the decline in TB in developed countries during this century, a major contributor has been the decline in the number of effective contacts by each case over time. Similar declines have doubtless occurred over the past century for many infections in developed countries.},

abstract = {Vaccination has proved a powerful defence against a range of infectious diseases of humans and animals. However, its potential to control major epidemics of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in livestock is contentious. Using an individual farm-based model, we consider either national prophylactic vaccination campaigns in advance of an outbreak, or combinations of reactive vaccination and culling strategies during an epidemic. Consistent with standard epidemiological theory, mass prophylactic vaccination could reduce greatly the potential for a major epidemic, while the targeting of high-risk farms increases efficiency. Given sufficient resources and preparation, a combination of reactive vaccination and culling might control ongoing epidemics. We also explore a reactive strategy, 'predictive' vaccination, which targets key spatial transmission loci and can reduce markedly the long tail that characterizes many FMD epidemics. These analyses have broader implications for the control of human and livestock infectious diseases in heterogeneous spatial landscapes.},

abstract = {Missing data are unavoidable in epidemiological and clinical research but their potential to undermine the validity of research results has often been overlooked in the medical literature (1). This is partly because statistical methods that can tackle problems arising from missing data have, until recently, not been readily accessible to medical researchers. However, multiple imputationa relatively flexible, general purpose approach to dealing with missing datais now available in standard statistical software,(2,5) making it possible to handle missing data semiroutinely. Results based on this computationally intensive method are increasingly reported, but it needs to be applied carefully to avoid misleading conclusions. In this article, we review the reasons why missing data may lead to bias and loss of information in epidemiological and clinical research. We discuss the circumstances in which multiple imputation may help by reducing bias or increasing precision, as well as describing potential pitfalls in its application. Finally, we describe the recent use and reporting of analyses using multiple imputation in general medical journals, and suggest guidelines for the conduct and reporting of such analyses.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Failure to convert (persistent sputum and/or culture positivity) while on antituberculosis (anti-TB) treatment at the end of the second month of anti-TB therapy has been reported to be a predictor of treatment failure. Factors that could be associated with persistent bacillary positivity at the end of the second month after initiation of anti-TB treatment were assessed. METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted in 754 patients with sputum culture positive pulmonary TB in Mwanza, Tanzania. Information on social demographic characteristics, anthropometric measurements, BCG scar status, HIV status, CD4+ count, white blood cell count, haemoglobin and sputum culture status was obtained. RESULTS: Factors associated with sputum culture non-conversion at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment were initial acid-fast bacilli (AFB) culture grading of 3+ (OR 5.70, 95{\%} CI 1.34 to 24.31, p=0.02) and absence of a BCG scar (OR 3.35, 95{\%} CI 1.48 to 7.58, p=0.004). CONCLUSION: Patients with pulmonary TB with no BCG scar and high initial AFB sputum intensity are at risk of remaining sputum culture positive at the end of the second month of anti-TB treatment. These findings reflect a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on sputum conversion which should also be examined in large studies in other areas. The finding of a beneficial role for BCG vaccination on the treatment of pulmonary TB is important for TB control and vaccination programmes.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a growing impediment to the control of infectious diseases worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) being among them. TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70{\%} of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80{\%} of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis are emerging worldwide. The Green Light Committee initiative supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 90 countries. We used estimates from the Preserving Effective TB Treatment Study to predict MDR and XDR tuberculosis trends in four countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis: India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa. METHODS: We calibrated a compartmental model to data from drug resistance surveys and WHO tuberculosis reports to forecast estimates of incident MDR and XDR tuberculosis and the percentage of incident MDR and XDR tuberculosis caused by acquired drug resistance, assuming no fitness cost of resistance from 2000 to 2040 in India, the Philippines, Russia, and South Africa. FINDINGS: The model forecasted the percentage of MDR tuberculosis among incident cases of tuberculosis to increase, reaching 12.4{\%} (95{\%} prediction interval 9.4-16.2) in India, 8.9{\%} (4.5-11.7) in the Philippines, 32.5{\%} (27.0-35.8) in Russia, and 5.7{\%} (3.0-7.6) in South Africa in 2040. It also predicted the percentage of XDR tuberculosis among incident MDR tuberculosis to increase, reaching 8.9{\%} (95{\%} prediction interval 5.1-12.9) in India, 9.0{\%} (4.0-14.7) in the Philippines, 9.0{\%} (4.8-14.2) in Russia, and 8.5{\%} (2.5-14.7) in South Africa in 2040. Acquired drug resistance would cause less than 30{\%} of incident MDR tuberculosis during 2000-40. Acquired drug resistance caused 80{\%} of incident XDR tuberculosis in 2000, but this estimate would decrease to less than 50{\%} by 2040. INTERPRETATION: MDR and XDR tuberculosis were forecast to increase in all four countries despite improvements in acquired drug resistance shown by the Green Light Committee-supported programmatic management of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Additional control efforts beyond improving acquired drug resistance rates are needed to stop the spread of MDR and XDR tuberculosis in countries with a high burden of MDR tuberculosis.

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) granulomas are organized collections of immune cells comprised of macrophages, lymphocytes and other cells that form in the lung as a result of immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. Formation and maintenance of granulomas are essential for control of Mtb infection and are regulated in part by a pro-inflammatory cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF). To characterize mechanisms that control TNF availability within a TB granuloma, we developed a multi-scale two compartment partial differential equation model that describes a granuloma as a collection of immune cells forming concentric layers and includes TNF/TNF receptor binding and trafficking processes. We used the results of sensitivity analysis as a tool to identify experiments to measure critical model parameters in an artificial experimental model of a TB granuloma induced in the lungs of mice following injection of mycobacterial antigen-coated beads. Using our model, we then demonstrated that the organization of immune cells within a TB granuloma as well as TNF/TNF receptor binding and intracellular trafficking are two important factors that control TNF availability and may spatially coordinate TNF-induced immunological functions within a granuloma. Further, we showed that the neutralization power of TNF-neutralizing drugs depends on their TNF binding characteristics, including TNF binding kinetics, ability to bind to membrane-bound TNF and TNF binding stoichiometry. To further elucidate the role of TNF in the process of granuloma development, our modeling and experimental findings on TNF-associated molecular scale aspects of the granuloma can be incorporated into larger scale models describing the immune response to TB infection. Ultimately, these modeling and experimental results can help identify new strategies for TB disease control/therapy.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: It is believed that nonadherence is the proximate cause of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-tuberculosis) emergence. The level of nonadherence associated with emergence of MDR-tuberculosis is unknown. Performance of a randomized controlled trial in which some patients are randomized to nonadherence would be unethical; therefore, other study designs should be utilized. METHODS: We performed hollow fiber studies for both bactericidal and sterilizing effect, with inoculum spiked with 0.5{\%} rifampin- and isoniazid-resistant isogenic strains in some experiments. Standard therapy was administered daily for 28-56 days, with extents of nonadherence varying between 0{\%} and 100{\%}. Sizes of drug-resistant populations were compared using analysis of variance. We also explored the effect of pharmacokinetic variability on MDR-tuberculosis emergence using computer-aided clinical trial simulations of 10 000 Cape Town, South Africa, tuberculosis patients. RESULTS: Therapy failure was only encountered at extents of nonadherence {\textgreater}/=60{\%}. Surprisingly, isoniazid- and rifampin-resistant populations did not achieve {\textgreater}/=1{\%} proportion in any experiment and did not achieve a higher proportion with nonadherence. However, clinical trial simulations demonstrated that approximately 1{\%} of tuberculosis patients with perfect adherence would still develop MDR-tuberculosis due to pharmacokinetic variability alone. CONCLUSIONS: These data, based on a preclinical model, demonstrate that nonadherence alone is not a sufficient condition for MDR-tuberculosis emergence.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: No clear evidence on the comparative effectiveness of delamanid (DLM) and bedaquiline (BDQ) has been published. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to estimate the incremental effectiveness of DLM versus BDQ in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). METHODS: We developed a Markov model based on a cohort with MDR-TB, which consisted of success, failure, loss to follow-up, and death. The cohort simulation was conducted assuming each patient was 36 years old and, lived until age 82, and that the cycle length was 1 year. Patients with an inadequate response to DLM, the background regimen, or BDQ for 2 years were transitioned through the next treatment sequence. We evaluated the incremental effectiveness of the drugs using the quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) resulting from this Markov model over a lifetime. RESULTS: The incremental effectiveness of DLM (13.96 QALYs) was greater by 2.44 QALYs per patient than the background regimen (11.52 QALY), while the incremental effectiveness of BDQ (10.40 QALY) was higher by 1.14 QALY per patient than the background regimen (9.26 QALY). Consequently, the incremental effectiveness of DLM was relatively more positive by 1.30 QALY than those of BDQ per patient over a lifetime. LIMITATIONS: This study is a simulation study. Therefore, the treatment sequence for patients may be different in the real world. CONCLUSIONS: Our lifetime simulated data found that DLM was relatively more favorable than BDQ. A Markov model can be considered an alternative approach when there is an absence of head-to-head clinical data.},

In this paper, the mathematical model can be used to provide insight into the dynamics of co-epidemic HIV-TB is the most effective. In particular, we examined the effects of re-infection of TB in the susceptible heterosexual population. We have obtained the effect re-infection TB in heterosexual population significant to the magnitude of the basic reproduction number. In a simulation model of the rate of transition from exposed to active TB is much shorter than the transition from individual latent HIV to individuals with HIV less attention.

abstract = {Environmental control measures (ventilation, high-efficiency particulate air filtration, and upper room ultraviolet germicidal irradiation [UVGI]) are recommended to effectively control tuberculosis (TB) transmission from unsuspected TB patients in high-risk settings, but the effectiveness of their use is not often clear. This study presents a simulation model for a hypothetical hospital waiting room, in which the number of susceptible immunocompetent people in the waiting room follows a Poisson distribution (M = 5) in either low (annual number of TB patients = 5) or high TB risk settings (annual number of TB patients = 50), and used the model to evaluate the reduction of TB transmission risk by upper room UVGI. An exponential dose-response model was used for TB transmission and a two-zone model was used for evaluating the effect of upper room UVGI. Upper room UVGI reduced TB risk by 1.6-fold at 3 microW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the low TB risk setting and by 4.1-fold at 15 microW/cm2 UV irradiance in the upper room in the high TB risk setting. Use of upper room UVGI also reduced the mean annual new infection rate from 2.2 to 1.3 infections per year at 3 microW/cm2 and to 0.6 infections per year at 15 microW/cm2 in our hypothetical high-risk settings. The effect of upper room UVGI was sensitive to both vertical air velocity (air mixing) and UV irradiance level. Results from partitioning variability indicate that most variability of TB transmission risk came from waiting time in our hypothetical hospital.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of human mortality due to infectious disease. Treatment default is a relevant factor which reduces therapeutic success and increases the risk of resistant TB. In this work we analyze the relation between treatment default and treatment length along with its consequence on the disease spreading. We use a stylized model structure to explore, systematically, the effects of varying treatment duration and compliance. We find that shortening treatment alone may not reduce TB prevalence, especially in regions where transmission intensity is high, indicating the necessity of complementing this action with increased compliance. A family of default functions relating the proportion of defaulters to the treatment length is considered and adjusted to a particular dataset. We find that the epidemiological benefits of shorter treatment regimens are tightly associated with increases in treatment compliance and depend on the epidemiological background.},

abstract = {There has been an increasing interest in the analysis of spatially distributed multivariate binary data motivated by a wide range of research problems. Two types of correlations are usually involved: the correlation between the multiple outcomes at one location and the spatial correlation between the locations for one particular outcome. The commonly used regression models only consider one type of correlations while ignoring or modeling inappropriately the other one. To address this limitation, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach to jointly modeling multivariate spatial binary data by integrating both types of correlations. A multivariate probit model is employed to link the binary outcomes to Gaussian latent variables; and Gaussian processes are applied to specify the spatially correlated random effects. We develop an efficient Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the posterior computation. We illustrate the proposed model on simulation studies and a multidrug-resistant tuberculosis case study.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Isoniazid given daily for 9 months is the standard treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), but its effectiveness is limited by poor completion rates. Shorter course regimens and regimens using directly observed therapy result in improved adherence but have higher upfront costs. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the costs and cost-effectiveness of regimens for the treatment of LTBI. METHODS: We used a computerized Markov model to estimate total societal costs and benefits associated with four regimens for the treatment of LTBI: self-administered isoniazid daily for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid twice-weekly for 9 months, directly observed isoniazid plus rifapentine once weekly for 3 months, and self-administered rifampin daily for 4 months. In the base-case analysis, subjects were assumed to have newly positive tuberculin skin tests after recent exposure to infectious tuberculosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We determined the costs of treatment, quality-adjusted life-years gained, and cases of active tuberculosis prevented. In the base-case analysis, rifampin dominated (less costly with increased benefits) all other regimens except isoniazid plus rifapentine, which was more effective at a cost {\$}48,997 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Isoniazid plus rifapentine dominated all regimens at a relative risk of disease 5.2 times the baseline estimate, or with completion rates less than 34{\%} for isoniazid or 37{\%} for rifampin. Rifampin could be 17{\%} less efficacious than self-administered isoniazid and still be cost-saving compared with this regimen. CONCLUSIONS: In our model, rifampin is cost-saving compared with the standard therapy of self-administered isoniazid. Isoniazid plus rifapentine is cost-saving for extremely high-risk patients and is cost-effective for lower-risk patients.},

In some countries such as South Africa, drug-resistant tuberculosis represents less than 3{\%} of all cases but consumes more than a third of the total national budget for tuberculosis, which is unsustainable and threatens to destabilise national tuberculosis programmes. However, concern about drug-resistant tuberculosis has been eclipsed by that of totally and extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis--ie, resistance to all or nearly all conventional first-line and second-line antituberculosis drugs. In this Review, we discuss the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, management, implications for health-care workers, and ethical and medicolegal aspects of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis and other resistant strains. Finally, we discuss the emerging problem of functionally untreatable tuberculosis, and the issues and challenges that it poses to public health and clinical practice. The emergence and growth of highly resistant strains of tuberculosis make the development of new drugs and rapid diagnostics for tuberculosis--and increased funding to strengthen global control efforts, research, and advocacy--even more pressing.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the costs and health effects of tuberculosis control interventions in Africa and South East Asia in the context of the millennium development goals. DESIGN: Cost effectiveness analysis based on an epidemiological model. SETTING: Analyses undertaken for two regions classified by WHO according to their epidemiological grouping-Afr-E, countries in sub-Saharan Africa with very high adult and high child mortality, and Sear-D, countries in South East Asia with high adult and high child mortality. DATA SOURCES: Published studies, costing databases, expert opinion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Costs per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted in 2000 international dollars (dollarsInt). RESULTS: Treatment of new cases of smear-positive tuberculosis in DOTS programmes cost dollarsInt6-8 per DALY averted in Afr-E and dollarsInt7 per DALY averted in Sear-D at coverage levels of 50-95{\%}. In Afr-E, adding treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases at a coverage level of 95{\%} cost dollarsInt95 per DALY averted; the addition of DOTS-Plus treatment for multidrug resistant cases cost dollarsInt123. In Sear-D, these costs were dollarsInt52 and dollarsInt226, respectively. The full combination of interventions could reduce prevalence and mortality by over 50{\%} in Sear-D between 1990 and 2010, and by almost 50{\%} between 2000 and 2010 in Afr-E. CONCLUSIONS: DOTS treatment of new smear-positive cases is the first priority in tuberculosis control, including in countries with high HIV prevalence. DOTS treatment of smear-negative and extra-pulmonary cases and DOTS-Plus treatment of multidrug resistant cases are also highly cost effective. To achieve the millennium development goal for tuberculosis control, substantial extra investment is needed to increase case finding and implement interventions on a wider scale.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis, first proposed by Chaussinand, that individual-level immunity acquired from exposure to tuberculosis may have contributed to the disappearance of leprosy from western Europe. METHODS: The epidemiological consequences of cross-immunity were assessed by the formulation of a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis and leprosy. RESULTS: The conditions under which Mycobacterium tuberculosis could have eradicated Mycobacterium leprae were derived in terms of the basic reproductive rates of the two infections and the degree of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: If the degree of cross-immunity between two diseases within an individual is known, then the epidemiological consequences of this cross-immunity can be assessed with transmission modeling. The results of this analysis, in combination with previous estimates of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis and degree of cross-immunity, imply that tuberculosis could have contributed to the decline of leprosy if the basic reproductive rate of leprosy was low.},

OBJECTIVE: To examine the cost-effectiveness of DOTS in Rio de Janeiro. DESIGN: Cost-effectiveness analysis based on cost data and an epidemiological model based on programmatic outcomes from the Health Department in Rio de Janeiro, cost data from the retail market sector and epidemiological data from published studies. RESULTS: The 10-year cost of a tuberculosis program treating a population of 262 000 based on self-administered therapy (SAT) was estimated to be {\$}580 271 compared to {\$}1047 886 for DOTS. The largest portion of the DOTS budget was for staff costs and costs incurred by patients, both at 28{\%}. For SAT, the largest percentage of the budget was allocated to medication costs, at 34{\%}. Upgrading from SAT to DOTS averted 1558 cases of tuberculosis (TB, uncertainty range [UR] 1418-1704) and 143 TB deaths (UR 131-155). The incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) for DOTS was {\$}300 per case averted (UR {\$}289-{\$}312) and {\$}3270 per death averted (UR {\$}3123-{\$}3435). In terms of disability adjusted life years (DALYs), DOTS saved 5426 DALYs (UR 4908-5961). The ICER for DOTS was {\$}86 per DALY saved (UR {\$}74-{\$}100).

@article{Prats2015,
abstract = {For millennia tuberculosis (TB) has shown a successful strategy to survive, making it one of the world's deadliest infectious diseases. This resilient behavior is based not only on remaining hidden in most of the infected population, but also by showing slow evolution in most sick people. The course of the disease within a population is highly related to its heterogeneity. Thus, classic epidemiological approaches with a top-down perspective have not succeeded in understanding its dynamics. In the past decade a few individual-based models were built, but most of them preserved a top-down view that makes it difficult to study a heterogeneous population. We propose an individual-based model developed with a bottom-up approach to studying the dynamics of pulmonary TB in a certain population, considered constant. Individuals may belong to the following classes: healthy, infected, sick, under treatment, and treated with a probability of relapse. Several variables and parameters account for their age, origin (native or immigrant), immunodeficiency, diabetes, and other risk factors (smoking and alcoholism). The time within each infection state is controlled, and sick individuals may show a cavitated disease or not that conditions infectiousness. It was implemented in NetLogo because it allows non-modelers to perform virtual experiments with a user-friendly interface. The simulation was conducted with data from Ciutat Vella, a district of Barcelona with an incidence of 67 TB cases per 100,000 inhabitants in 2013. Several virtual experiments were performed to relate the disease dynamics with the structure of the infected subpopulation (e.g., the distribution of infected times). Moreover, the short-term effect of health control policies on modifying that structure was studied. Results show that the characteristics of the population are crucial for the local epidemiology of TB. The developed user-friendly tool is ready to test control strategies of disease in any city in the short-term.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To develop more effective methods to assess tuberculosis (TB) control strategies so we can meet national goals for the elimination of TB in the United States. DESIGN: Using a semi-Markov model that divided the US population into 3 age groups and 18 clinical states based on disease status and risk for TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, we measured the effects of 5 changes in TB policy, introduced singly and in combination: (1) increased coverage and (2) improved efficacy of preventive therapy, (3) increased coverage and (4) improved efficacy of treatment, and (5) introduction of BCG vaccination. RESULTS: A BCG vaccination program that reached 10{\%} of eligible children and 1{\%} of eligible adults each year would produce a 17{\%} reduction in cases and an 11{\%} decline in deaths over 10 years. Preventive therapy programs among the general population would have little effect on the number of TB cases, but a program targeting HIV-infected patients would reduce HIV-associated TB cases and deaths 14{\%} to 20{\%}. A 10{\%} improvement in the coverage and efficacy of both preventive therapy and treatment, coupled with the BCG vaccination program, would lead to a 47{\%} decline in TB cases and a 50{\%} decline in TB deaths relative to baseline over 10 years. CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in treatment coverage or effectiveness alone are unlikely to reach established national goals for the elimination of TB. These goals can be achieved through a combination of improvements in current programs with targeted preventive therapy and BCG vaccination programs.},

abstract = {There is increasing recognition that reinfection is an important component of TB transmission. Moreover, it has been shown that partial immunity has significant epidemiological consequences, particularly in what concerns disease prevalence and effectiveness of control measures. We address the problem of drug resistance as a competition between two types of strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis: those that are sensitive to anti-tuberculosis drugs and those that are resistant. Our objective is to characterise the role of reinfection in the transmission of drug-resistant tuberculosis. The long-term behaviour of our model reflects how reinfection modifies the conditions for coexistence of sensitive and resistant strains. This sets the scene for discussing how strain prevalence is affected by different control strategies. It is shown that intervention effectiveness is highly sensitive to the baseline epidemiological setting. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

It has been shown that the dynamics of both models are governed by a reproductive number. All solutions converge to the origin (the disease-free equilibrium) when this reproductive number is less than or equal to the critical value one. The disease-free equilibrium is unstable and there exists a unique positive (endemic) equilibrium if the reproductive number exceeds one. Moreover, the positive equilibrium is stable.

abstract = {Objective To estimate the risk and prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) infection and tuberculosis (TB) incidence, prevalence, and mortality, including disease attributable to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for 212 countries in 1997. Participants A panel of 86 TB experts and epidemiologists from more than 40 countries was chosen by the World Health Organization (WHO), with final agreement be- ing reached between country experts and WHO staff. Evidence Incidence of TB and mortality in each country was determined by(1)case notification to the WHO, (2) annual risk of infection data from tuberculin surveys, and (3) data on prevalence of smear-positive pulmonary disease from prevalence surveys. Estimates derived from relatively poor data were strongly influenced by panel member opinion. Objective estimates were derived from high-quality data collected recently by approved procedures. Consensus Process Agreement was reached by (1) participants reviewing methods and data and making provisional estimates in closed workshops held at WHO's 6 regional offices, (2) principal authors refining estimates using standard methods and all available data, and (3) country experts reviewing and adjusting these estimates and reaching final agreement with WHO staff. Conclusions In1997, new cases of TB totaled an estimated 7.96 million (range, 6.3 million–11.1 million), including 3.52 million (2.8 million–4.9 million) cases (44{\%}) of infectious pulmonary disease (smear-positive), and there were 16.2 million (12.1 million– 22.5 million) existing cases of disease. An estimated 1.87 million (1.4 million–2.8 mil- lion) people died of TB and the global case fatality rate was 23{\%} but exceeded 50{\%} in some African countries with high HIV rates. Global prevalence of MTB infection was 32{\%} (1.86 billion people). Eighty percent of all incident TB cases were found in 22 countries, with more than half the cases occurring in 5 Southeast Asian countries. Nine of 10 countries with the highest incidence rates per capita were in Africa. Prevalence of MTB/HIV coinfection worldwide was 0.18{\%} and 640 000 incident TB cases (8{\%}) had HIV infection. The global burden of tuberculosis remains enormous, mainly be- cause of poor control in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and eastern Europe, and because of high rates of M tuberculosis and HIV coinfection in some African countries.},

Using this model, we are able to investigate the spatial organization of the immune response in the lungs to Mtb. We identify both host and pathogen factors that contribute to successful infection control. Additionally, we identify specific spatial interactions and mechanisms important for successful granuloma formation. These results can be further studied in the experimental setting.},

A mathematical model which includes important components such as undiagnosed infectious, diagnosed infectious, latently infected and lost-sight infectious is formulated. The model combines a frequency dependent and a density dependent force of infection for TB transmission. Through optimal control theory and numerical simulations, a cost-effective balance of two different intervention methods is obtained. Seeking to minimize the amount of money the government spends when tuberculosis remain endemic in the Cameroonian population, Pontryagin's maximum principle is used to characterize the optimal control. The optimality system is derived and solved numerically using the forward–backward sweep method (FBSM). Results provide a framework for designing cost-effective strategies for diseases with multiple intervention methods. It comes out that combining chemoprophylaxis and education, the burden of TB can be reduced by 80{\%} in 10years.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To describe the recent trends in demographic, clinical and microbiological characteristics and outcome of treatment in paediatric cases of tuberculosis. DESIGN: National surveillance study. SETTING: England and Wales. PATIENTS: All children under the age of 16 years reported with tuberculosis to the national enhanced surveillance system between 1999 and 2006 were included. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Proportions, and rates of disease, by demographic characteristics, site of disease, diagnostic delay, culture confirmation, species, drug susceptibility and treatment outcome. RESULTS: 3563 cases of tuberculosis in children were reported between 1999 and 2006. The incidence rate remained stable at around 4.3 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI 4.1 to 4.4). Patients born outside the UK had a tuberculosis rate higher than children born in the UK (37 per 100,000 vs 2.5 per 100,000) and this rate increased over the period. Rates in the black African ethnic group were highest at 88 per 100,000. 60{\%} of children had pulmonary disease, the commonest presentation, but only 948 (27{\%}) had culture confirmed tuberculosis. The median time to diagnosis from onset of symptoms was 37 days (interquartile range 12-89). The proportions of cases with rifampicin, isoniazid and multi-drug resistant isolates were 2.4{\%}, 9.3{\%} and 2.3{\%}, respectively. 88{\%} of children completed treatment and less than 1{\%} died. CONCLUSIONS: Overall rates of tuberculosis in children have remained stable, with the majority completing treatment. Rates are, however, highest in children not born in the UK, particularly among certain ethnic minority groups. Levels of drug resistance are also high.},

abstract = {The expected upsurge in the number of new cases of tuberculosis resulting from the HIV/AIDS epidemic prompted an examination of the feasibility of prevention strategies to limit the increase in clinical tuberculosis. A computer spreadsheet model was developed to estimate the costs and benefits that would result from isoniazid chemoprophylaxis for tuberculosis in a hypothetical cohort of 100,000 HIV-seropositive people in South Africa over a period of 8 years. At a 50{\%} prevalence of tuberculosis infection among those at high background risk, and 5-10{\%} among those at low risk, there would have been 34,000 cases of active tuberculosis in the cohort and their contacts if no prophylactic therapy had been used. On the other hand, a chemoprophylaxis policy would have meant only 12,200 cases of tuberculosis, if a patient compliance rate of 68.5{\%} had been assumed. Such a policy would have prevented 21,800 cases of active tuberculosis. The estimated total discounted cost of a chemoprophylaxis programme would have been R51.3 million. In the absence of preventive therapy the discounted cost of treating patients with active tuberculosis would have been R91.9 million over the 8-year period. Therefore, if the benefits of chemoprophylaxis were defined in terms of averted health care costs, such a policy would have resulted in net savings of R40.6 million. This study did not estimate losses in production associated with tuberculosis treatment or the value of preventing tuberculosis per se, though such indirect costs would have increased the benefit of the prevention programme.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is complex. Experimental evidence has revealed that tumor necrosis factor (TNF) plays a major role in host defense against Mtb in both active and latent phases of infection. TNF-neutralizing drugs used to treat inflammatory disorders have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB), in accordance with animal studies. The present study takes a computational approach toward characterizing the role of TNF in protection against the tubercle bacillus in both active and latent infection. We extend our previous mathematical models to investigate the roles and production of soluble (sTNF) and transmembrane TNF (tmTNF). We analyze effects of anti-TNF therapy in virtual clinical trials (VCTs) by simulating two of the most commonly used therapies, anti-TNF antibody and TNF receptor fusion, predicting mechanisms that explain observed differences in TB reactivation rates. The major findings from this study are that bioavailability of TNF following anti-TNF therapy is the primary factor for causing reactivation of latent infection and that sTNF--even at very low levels--is essential for control of infection. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish mechanisms of action of the anti-TNF treatments and gain insights into the role of TNF in TB control and pathology. Our study suggests that a TNF-modulating agent could be developed that could balance the requirement for reduction of inflammation with the necessity to maintain resistance to infection and microbial diseases. Alternatively, the dose and timing of anti-TNF therapy could be modified. Anti-TNF therapy will likely lead to numerous incidents of primary TB if used in areas where exposure is likely.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Molecular resistance detection (MRD) of resistance to second-line anti-tuberculous drugs provides faster results than phenotypic tests, may shorten treatment and allow earlier separation among patients with and without second-line drug resistance. METHODS: In a decision-analytical model we simulated a cohort of patients diagnosed with TB in a setting where drug resistant TB is highly prevalent and requires initial hospitalization, to explore the potential benefits of a high-throughput MRD-assay for reducing potential nosocomial transmission of highly resistant strains, and total costs for diagnosis of drug resistance, treatment and hospitalization. In the base case scenario first-line drug resistance was diagnosed with WHO-endorsed molecular tests, and second-line drug resistance with culture and phenotypic methods. Three alternative scenarios were explored, each deploying high-throughput MRD allowing either detection of second-line mutations in cultured isolates, directly on sputum, or MRD with optimized markers. RESULTS: Compared to a base case scenario, deployment of high-throughput MRD reduced total costs by 17-21 {\%}. The period during which nosocomial transmission may take place increased by 15 {\%} compared to the base case if MRD had currently reported suboptimal sensitivity and required cultured isolates; increased by 7 {\%} if direct sputum analysis were possible including in patients with smear-negative TB, and reduced by 24 {\%} if the assay had improved markers, but was still performed on cultured isolates. Improved clinical sensitivity of the assay (additional markers) by more than 35 {\%} would be needed to avoid compromising infection control. CONCLUSIONS: Further development of rapid second-line resistance testing should prioritize investment in optimizing markers above investments in a platform for direct analysis of sputum.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is returning to be a worldwide global public health threat. It is estimated that 9.6 million cases occurred in 2014, of which just two-thirds notified to public health authorities. The "missing cases" constitute a severe challenge for TB transmission control. TB is a severe disease in India, while, worldwide, the WHO estimates that one third of the entire world population is infected. Nowadays, incidence estimation relies increasingly more on notifications of new cases from routine surveillance. There is an urgent need for better estimates of the load of TB, in high-burden settings. We developed a simple model of TB transmission dynamics, using a dynamical system model, consisting of six classes of individuals. It contains the current medical epidemiologists' understanding of the spread of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis in humans, which is substantiated by field observations at the district level in India. The model incorporates the treatment options provided by the public and private sectors in India. Mathematically, an interesting feature of the system is that it exhibits a backward, or subcritical, bifurcation. One of the results of the investigation shows that the discrepancy between the diagnosis rates of the public and private sector does not seem to be the cause of the endemicity of the disease, and, unfortunately, even if they reached 100{\%} of correct diagnosis, this would not be enough to achieve disease eradication. Several other approaches have been attempted on the basis of this model to indicate possible strategies that may lead to disease eradication, but the rather sad conclusion is that they unfortunately do not appear viable in practice.},

abstract = {The risk of developing active tuberculosis is highest within the first 2 years of infection. Therefore, an intervention that targets persons with recent infection, such as identifying contacts of active cases, could be particularly effective as an epidemic control measure. A mathematical model of a tuberculosis epidemic is formulated and used to evaluate the strategy of targeting therapy to persons with recently acquired latent tuberculosis infection. The model is used to quantify the effectiveness of therapy for early latent tuberculosis infection in reducing the prevalence of active tuberculosis. The model is also used to demonstrate how effective therapy for early latent tuberculosis infection has to be to eliminate tuberculosis, when used in conjunction with therapy for active tuberculosis. Analysis of the model suggests that programs such as contact investigations, which identify and treat persons recently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, may have a substantial effect on controlling tuberculosis epidemics.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the duration of protection by bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) may exceed previous estimates with potential implications for estimating clinical and cost-efficacy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the protection and duration of protection provided by BCG vaccination against tuberculosis, explore how this protection changes with time since vaccination, and examine the reasons behind the variation in protection and the rate of waning of protection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Databases, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Web of Knowledge, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs), MEDCARIB Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched from inception to May 2009. Index to Theses, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI) Abstracts, Scopus, Article First, Academic Complete, Africa-Wide Information, Google Scholar, Global Health, British National Bibliography for Report Literature, and clinical trial registration websites were searched from inception to October 2009.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases searches, screening of identified studies, data extraction and analysis were undertaken. Meta-analysis was used to present numerical and graphical summaries of clinical efficacy and efficacy by time since vaccination. Evidence of heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic. Meta-regression allowed the investigation of observed heterogeneity. Factors investigated included BCG strain, latitude, stringency of pre-BCG vaccination tuberculin testing, age at vaccination, site of disease, study design and vulnerability to biases. Rate of waning of protection was estimated using the ratio of the measure of efficacy after 10 years compared with the efficacy in the first 10 years of a study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Study selection. A total of 21,030 references were identified, providing data on 132 studies after abstract and full-text review. Efficacy. Protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults is variable, ranging from substantial protection in the UK MRC trial {\{}rate ratio 0.22 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.31]{\}}, to absence of clinically important benefit, as in the large Chingleput trial [rate ratio 1.05 (95{\%} CI 0.88 to 1.25)] and greater in latitudes further away from the equator. BCG vaccination efficacy was usually high, and varied little by form of disease (with higher protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis) or study design when BCG vaccination was given only to infants or to children after strict screening for tuberculin sensitivity. High levels of protection against death were observed from both trials and observational studies. The observed protective effect of BCG vaccination did not differ by the strain of BCG vaccine used in trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDURATION: Reviewed studies showed that BCG vaccination protects against pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis for up to 10 years. Most studies either did not follow up participants for long enough or had very few cases after 15 years. This should not be taken to indicate an absence of effect: five studies (one trial and four observational studies) provided evidence of measurable protection at least 15 years after vaccination. Efficacy declined with time. The rate of decline was variable, with faster decline in latitudes further from the equator and in situations where BCG vaccination was given to tuberculin-sensitive participants after stringent tuberculin testing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this review relates to quality of included trials, most of which were conducted before current standards for reporting were formulated. In addition, data were lacking in some areas and the review had to rely on evidence from observational studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BCG vaccination protection against tuberculosis varies between populations, to an extent that cannot be attributed to chance alone. Failure to exclude those already sensitised to mycobacteria and study latitude closer to the equator were associated with lower efficacy. These factors explained most of the observed variation. There is good evidence that BCG vaccination protection declines with time and that protection can last for up to 10 years. Data on protection beyond 15 years are limited; however, a small number of trials and observational studies suggest that BCG vaccination may protect for longer. Further studies are required to investigate the duration of protection by BCG vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In May, 2016, WHO endorsed a 9 month regimen for multidrug-resistant tuberculosis that is cheaper and potentially more effective than the conventional, longer (20-24 month) therapy. We aimed to investigate the population-level implications of scaling up this new regimen. METHODS: In this population modelling analysis, we developed a dynamic transmission model to simulate the introduction of this short-course regimen as an instantaneous switch in 2016. We projected the corresponding percentage reduction in the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis by 2024 compared with continued use of longer therapy. In the primary analysis in a representative southeast Asian setting, we assumed that the short-course regimen would double treatment access (through savings in resources or capacity) and achieve long-term efficacy at levels seen in preliminary cohort studies. We then did extensive sensitivity analyses to explore a range of alternative scenarios. FINDINGS: Under the optimistic assumptions in the primary analysis, the incidence of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in 2024 would be 3.3 (95{\%} uncertainty range 2.2-5.6) per 100 000 population with the short-course regimen and 4.3 (2.9-7.6) per 100 000 population with continued use of longer therapy-ie, the short-course regimen could reduce incidence by 23{\%} (10-38). Incidence would be reduced by 14{\%} (4-28) if the new regimen affected only treatment effectiveness and by 11{\%} (3-24) if it affected only treatment availability. Under more pessimistic assumptions, the short-course regimen would have minimal effect and even potential for harm-eg, when 30{\%} of patients are ineligible for the new regimen because of second-line drug resistance, we projected a change in incidence of -2{\%} (-20 to +28). The new regimen's effect was greater in settings with more ongoing transmission of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, but results were otherwise similar across settings with different levels of tuberculosis incidence and prevalence of multidrug resistance. INTERPRETATION: The short-course regimen has potential to substantially lessen the multidrug-resistant tuberculosis epidemic, but this effect depends on its long-term efficacy, its ability to expand treatment access, and the role of second-line drug resistance.

They showed that the classification approach could fairly identify underlying characteristics of the disease system, without fitting various transmission models via, say, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We extend this work to the case where the underlying infectious disease model is inherently spatial.Our goal is to compare the use of global epidemic curves for building the classifier, with the use of spatially stratified epidemic curves.

These genes are expressed in vitro in response to nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), and nutrient starvation. The occurrence and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) is not clearly understood. The ability of the pathogen to enter and exit from different states is associated with its ability to cause persistent infection. During infection it is not known whether the organism is in a persistent slow replicating state or a dormant non-replicating state, with the latter ultimately causing a latent infection with the potential to reactivate to active disease. We collected gene expression data for Mtb bacilli under different stress conditions that simulate latency or dormancy. Time course experiments were selected and differentially expressed gene profiles were determined at each time point. A mathematical model was then developed to show the dynamics of Mtb latency based on the profile of differentially expressed genes. Analysis of the time course data show the dynamics of latency occurrence in vitro and the mathematical model reveals all possible scenarios of Mtb latency development with respect to the different conditions that may be produced by the immune response in vivo. The mathematical model provides a biological explanation of how Mtb latency occurs based on observed gene expression changes in in vitro latency models.},

abstract = {Biogeographical, evolutionary and ecological processes interact to regulate patterns in metacommunities. However, as there are few quantitative methods for evaluating their joint effects, resolving this interaction is difficult. We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cost-effective screening and treatment strategies for healthcare workers (HCWs) at risk for tuberculosis exposure. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to track three hypothetical cohorts of HCWs at low, moderate, and high risk for tuberculosis exposure. For those found to be tuberculin reactors at entry, the choice was for isoniazid treatment or no treatment. For those without tuberculin reactivity, the choice of screening intervals was 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, or 5 years. Outcomes measured were tuberculosis cases, death, life expectancy, and cost. Assumptions were derived from published data and analyses. RESULTS: Treatment of initial reactors with isoniazid in all three risk groups was associated with a net savings of {\$}14,800 to {\$}15,700 for each tuberculosis case prevented. For those without evidence of infection at entry, the most cost-effective screening interval was 1 year for high-risk groups, 2 years for moderate-risk groups, and 5 years for low-risk groups, with a net savings {\$}0.20 to {\$}26 per HCW per year. Screening at a more frequent interval was still cost-effective. CONCLUSIONS: For HCWs found to be tuberculin reactors, treatment of their latent infection is to their benefit and is associated with a net cost-savings. Regular tuberculin screening of HCWs can be cost-effective or result in a net cost-savings. Each institution could use its own skin test surveillance data to create an optimum screening program for its employees. However, for most HCWs, a 1-year screening interval would be a cost-effective and safe choice.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is wide variation in the techniques deployed to diagnose tuberculosis in the UK, with little agreement on which tools or strategies are cost effective. This analysis therefore comprehensively evaluated the cost effectiveness of currently available diagnostic strategies for routine diagnosis of TB in the NHS. METHODS: The analysis compared strategies consisting of Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques, culture and microscopy. A decision tree was used to estimate costs and Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs) from a UK health service perspective. The sensitivity and specificity of each test determined the true and false positive and negative results in patients suspected of having active tuberculosis. These results led to either early, correct diagnosis or delayed diagnosis and the associated costs and QALYs. The presence of active tuberculosis combined with the side effects of treatment was associated with reduction in quality of life. Costs included were test costs, drug costs and the management of tuberculosis. Drug costs were based on generic UK list prices. Uncertainty in the model was explored through probabilistic and deterministic sensitivity analyses. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: The cost effective strategy at threshold of pound20,000 per QALY was a strategy using only sputum microscopy and culture routinely, meaning Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques are not cost effective at baseline. When the prevalence of tuberculosis was increased, however, nucleic acid amplification became cost effective at the same threshold. Aside from the prevalence, the results were shown to be robust. At low tuberculosis prevalence, Nucleic Acid Amplification Techniques may not be cost effective but their potential in higher prevalence situations is considerable.},

abstract = {We estimate the proportion of tuberculosis (TB) in England due to recent household transmission, identify factors associated with being a household transmitter, and investigate the impact that identification of a case has on time to treatment of subsequent cases. TB cases notified between 2010 and 2012 in England in the same household as another case were identified; 24 locus MIRU-VNTR strain typing (ST) was used to identify household cases with likely recent transmission. Treatment delay in index and subsequent cases was compared. Risk factors for being a household transmitter were identified in univariable and multivariable analyses. Overall, 7.7{\%} (1849/24,060) of TB cases lived in a household with another case. We estimate that 3.9{\%} were due to recent household transmission. ST data was unavailable for 67{\%} (1242) of household pairs. For those with ST data, 64{\%} (386) had confirmed, 11{\%} probable (66) and 25{\%} (155) refuted household transmission. The median treatment delay was 65 days for index cases and 37 days for subsequent asymptomatic cases. Risk factors for being a household transmitter included being under 25 years old, UK-born with Black African, Indian or Pakistani ethnicity, or born in Somalia or Romania. This study has a number of implications for household TB contact tracing in low incidence countries, including the potential to reduce the diagnostic delay for subsequent household cases and the benefit of using ST to identify when to conduct source contact tracing outside the household. As 25{\%} of TB cases in households had discordant strains, households with multiple TB cases do not necessarily represent household transmission. The additional fact that 25{\%} of index cases within households only had extra-pulmonary TB demonstrates that, if household contact tracing is limited to pulmonary TB cases (as recently recommended in UK guidelines), additional cases of active TB in households will be missed. Our finding that no lineage of TB was associated with recent household transmission and with no increased transmissibility in the Beijing lineage compared to others, suggests that the lineage need not impact contact tracing efforts. Improvements in contact tracing have the potential to reduce transmission of TB in low incidence countries.},

abstract = {While bacillus Calmette-Guerin vaccination plays an important role in reducing the morbidity of tuberculosis (TB) infection during childhood, new tuberculosis vaccines are necessary to disrupt the transmission of disease and improve global control of this pathogen. Growing evidence of the presence of meaningful Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain diversity, coupled with the possibility that new vaccines may differentially protect against infection or disease with circulating M. tuberculosis strains, suggest that these vaccines may have complicated effects on disease dynamics. We use a mathematical model to explore the potential effects of strain diversity on the performance of vaccines and find that vaccines offer great promise for improving tuberculosis control, but the expected benefits of mass vaccination will be eroded if strain replacement with M. tuberculosis variants that are not effectively targeted by vaccines occurs. Determining the likelihood of strain replacement will require additional knowledge of the strain specificities of current vaccine candidates, and an improved understanding of the mechanisms of strain interaction, which are responsible for maintaining the diversity of M. tuberculosis within communities.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important public health problem in Canadian Aboriginal (First Nations and Inuit) communities. The objectives of this study were to predict future disease burden and set feasible targets for the elimination of TB in the First Nations population, using retrospective data and an epidemic model. Methods: Reported TB incidence data (1974-2002), previously published TB meningitis data from the pre-chemotherapy era, and previous estimates of disease risk following infection were used to estimate a trend in the annual risk of infection from 1929 to 2002, and the age-specific prevalence of infection in 2002. A state-transfer, compartmental model was then developed to predict future disease burden. Two scenarios were simulated, with different disease risk parameters. Results: The estimated prevalence of infection in 2002 was 20.9{\%} in scenario 1 and 25.5{\%} in scenario 2. Predicted incidence rates in 2015 were 16.8 per 100 000 and 11.7 per 100 000 for the two scenarios, respectively. The incidence of disease was not tower than 1 per 100 000 for either scenario in 2034, the arbitrarily chosen last year of the model. Conclusions: The goal of eliminating TB among Aboriginal peoples in Canada is a feasible one, but will only be achieved with continued investment in programs designed to control and prevent transmission. Reactivation disease cases may occur for a number of years to come, making rapid elimination a difficult goal. (C) 2008 International Society for Infectious Diseases. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The 2050 Millennium Development Goals (MDG) for tuberculosis (TB) aim for elimination of TB as a public health issue. We used a mathematical modelling approach to evaluate the feasibility of this target in a low-prevalence setting with immigration-related strategies directed at latent tuberculosis. METHODS: We used a stochastic individual-based model to simulate tuberculosis disease among immigrants to Victoria, Australia; a representative low-transmission setting. A variety of screening and treatment approaches aimed at preventing reactivation of latent infection were applied to evaluate overall tuberculosis incidence reduction and rates of multidrug resistant disease. RESULTS: Without additional intervention, tuberculosis incidence was predicted to reach 34.5 cases/million by 2050. Strategies involving the introduction of an available screening/treatment combination reduced TB incidence to between 16.9-23.8 cases/million, and required screening of 136-427 new arrivals for each case of TB prevented. Limiting screening to higher incidence regions of origin was less effective but more efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Public health strategies targeting latent tuberculosis infection in immigrants may substantially reduce tuberculosis incidence in a low prevalence region. However, immigration-focused strategies cannot achieve the 2050 MDG and alternative or complementary approaches are required.},

Concise, clearly presented, and up-to- date, $\backslash${\_}String Theory in a Nutshell$\backslash${\_} brings together the best understood and most important aspects of a theory that has been evolving since the early 1980s. A core model of physics that substitutes one-dimensional extended "strings" for zero-dimensional point-like particles (as in quantum field theory), string theory has been the leading candidate for a theory that would successfully unify all fundamental forces of nature, including gravity. Starting with the basic definitions of the theory, Elias Kiritsis guides readers through classic and modern topics. In particular, he treats perturbative string theory and its Conformal Field Theory (CFT) tools in detail while also developing nonperturbative aspects and exploring the unity of string interactions. He presents recent topics including black holes, their microscopic entropy, and the AdS/CFT correspondence. He also describes matrix model tools for string theory. In all, the book contains nearly five hundred exercises for the graduate-level student, and works as a self-contained and detailed guide to the literature. $\backslash${\_}String Theory in a Nutshell$\backslash${\_} is the staple one-volume reference on the subject not only for students and researchers of theoretical high-energy physics, but also for mathematicians and physicists specializing in theoretical cosmology and QCD.},

abstract = {A cardinal challenge in epidemiological and ecological modelling is to develop effective and easily deployed tools for model assessment. The availability of such methods would greatly improve understanding, prediction and management of disease and ecosystems. Conventional Bayesian model assessment tools such as Bayes factors and the deviance information criterion (DIC) are natural candidates but suffer from important limitations because of their sensitivity and complexity. Posterior predictive checks, which use summary statistics of the observed process simulated from competing models, can provide a measure of model fit but appropriate statistics can be difficult to identify. Here, we develop a novel approach for diagnosing mis-specifications of a general spatio-temporal transmission model by embedding classical ideas within a Bayesian analysis. Specifically, by proposing suitably designed non-centred parametrization schemes, we construct latent residuals whose sampling properties are known given the model specification and which can be used to measure overall fit and to elicit evidence of the nature of mis-specifications of spatial and temporal processes included in the model. This model assessment approach can readily be implemented as an addendum to standard estimation algorithms for sampling from the posterior distributions, for example Markov chain Monte Carlo. The proposed methodology is first tested using simulated data and subsequently applied to data describing the spread of Heracleum mantegazzianum (giant hogweed) across Great Britain over a 30-year period. The proposed methods are compared with alternative techniques including posterior predictive checking and the DIC. Results show that the proposed diagnostic tools are effective in assessing competing stochastic spatio-temporal transmission models and may offer improvements in power to detect model mis-specifications. Moreover, the latent-residual framework introduced here extends readily to a broad range of ecological and epidemiological models.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a growing impediment to the control of infectious diseases worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) being among them. TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70{\%} of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80{\%} of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To explore the potential impact of enhanced tuberculosis (TB) diagnostic techniques as a TB control strategy in an adult population with high HIV prevalence. DESIGN: A compartmental difference-equation model of TB/HIV was developed using parameter estimates from the literature. METHODS: The impact of five TB control interventions (rapid molecular testing, mycobacterial culture, community-wide and HIV-targeted active case finding, and highly active antiretroviral therapy) on TB incidence, prevalence, and mortality was modeled in a steady-state population with an HIV prevalence of 17{\%} and annual TB incidence of 409 per 100 000. Sensitivity analyses assessed the influence of each model parameter on the interventions' mortality impact. RESULTS: Enhanced diagnostic techniques (rapid molecular testing or culture) are each projected to reduce TB prevalence and mortality by 20{\%} or more, an impact similar to that of active case-finding in 33{\%} of the general community and greater than the effect achievable by case-finding or antiretroviral treatment efforts in HIV-positive patients alone. The projected impact of enhanced diagnostics on TB incidence ({\textless} 10{\%} reduction) is smaller. The impact of TB diagnostics is sensitive to the quality of existing diagnostic standards and the level of access to diagnostic services, but is robust across a wide range of population parameters including HIV and TB incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Enhanced TB diagnostic techniques may have substantial impact on TB morbidity and mortality in HIV-endemic regions. As TB rates continue to increase in these areas, enhanced diagnostic techniques merit further consideration as TB control strategies.},

abstract = {Despite great efforts to control the spread of tuberculosis (TB), the disease remains stubbornly persistent, having infected one third of the world population, and causing more than 1.5 million deaths annually. To better understand the epidemiology of TB, past modeling efforts have sought to understand how TB prevention and control policies affect infection spread in the population. This paper describes a preliminary dynamic model to evaluate the role of current contact tracing policies in managing TB transmission. Through a novel representation of contact tracing dynamics, the model supports investigation of how TB outcomes are affected by changes to the breadth and timeliness of contact investigation. Model results suggest that while successful contact tracing is self-limiting, it plays a critical role in TB control. Results also suggest that expanded breadth of contact tracing offers diminishing returns, and underscores the desirability of highly targeted contact tracing and the desirability of richer models.},

In this study we use mathematical modelling to explore the potential epidemiological impact of these new tests, with particular reference to India. Methods: A behavioural model of patient-doctor interactions embedded in an epidemiological model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis transmission, linked to field data, was used to investigate the effects of early diagnosis in preventing future TB cases. Results: New diagnostic tests for active TB will have a bigger impact sooner where: disease incidence is high and most cases are due to recent infection; advances in test technology (test sensitivity, specificity, etc.) are combined with early diagnosis; new tests have not only better technical specifications than current tests, but also compensate for the misuse of existing tests; health system delays are long compared with patient delays, assuming the former are more amenable to change. Interpretation {\&} conclusions: New diagnostic tests will certainly improve TB control, but the highest impact will be obtained by applying tests with higher sensitivity and specificity early in the infectious period. Refined behavioural and epidemiological models should be able to investigate the mechanisms by which early diagnosis could be achieved, in addition to the consequent epidemiological effects.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Development of new, effective, and affordable tuberculosis (TB) therapies has been identified as a critical priority for global TB control. As new candidates emerge from the global TB drug pipeline, the potential impacts of novel, shorter regimens on TB incidence and mortality have not yet been examined. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We used a mathematical model of TB to evaluate the expected benefits of shortening the duration of effective chemotherapy for active pulmonary TB. First, we considered general relationships between treatment duration and TB dynamics. Next, as a specific example, we calibrated the model to reflect the current situation in the South-East Asia region. We found that even with continued and rapid progress in scaling up the World Health Organization's DOTS strategy of directly observed, short-course chemotherapy, the benefits of reducing treatment duration would be substantial. Compared to a baseline of continuing DOTS coverage at current levels, and with currently available tools, a 2-mo regimen introduced by 2012 could prevent around 20{\%} (range 13{\%}-28{\%}) of new cases and 25{\%} (range 19{\%}-29{\%}) of TB deaths in South-East Asia between 2012 and 2030. If effective treatment with existing drugs expands rapidly, overall incremental benefits of shorter regimens would be lower, but would remain considerable (13{\%} [range 8{\%}-19{\%}] and 19{\%} [range 15{\%}-23{\%}] reductions in incidence and mortality, respectively, between 2012 and 2030). A ten-year delay in the introduction of new drugs would erase nearly three-fourths of the total expected benefits in this region through 2030. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of new, shorter treatment regimens could dramatically accelerate the reductions in TB incidence and mortality that are expected under current regimens-with up to 2- or 3-fold increases in rates of decline if shorter regimens are accompanied by enhanced case detection. Continued progress in reducing the global TB burden will require a balanced approach to pursuing new technologies while promoting wider implementation of proven strategies.},

abstract = {SETTING: Bleach sedimentation is a method used to increase the diagnostic yield of sputum microscopy for countries with a high prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and limited resources. OBJECTIVES: To compare the relative cost-effectiveness of different microscopy approaches in diagnosing tuberculosis (TB) in Kenya. METHODS: An analytical decision tree model including cost and effectiveness measures of 10 combinations of direct (D) and overnight bleach (B) sedimentation microscopy was constructed. Data were drawn from the evaluation of the bleach sedimentation method on two specimens (first on the spot [1] and second morning [2]) from 644 TB suspects in a peripheral health clinic. Incremental cost per smear-positive detected case was measured. Costs included human resources and materials using a micro-costing evaluation. RESULTS: All bleach-based microscopy approaches detected significantly more cases (between 23.3{\%} for B1 and 25.9{\%} for B1+B2) than the conventional D1+D2 approach (21.0{\%}). Cost per tested case ranged between respectively euro 2.7 and euro 4.5 for B1 and B1+D2+B2. B1 and B1+B2 were the most cost-effective approaches. D1+B2 and D1+B1 were good alternatives to avoid using approaches exclusively based on bleach sedimentation microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Among several effective microscopy approaches used, including sodium hypochlorite sedimentation, only some resulted in a limited increase in the laboratory workload and would be most suitable for programmatic implementation.},

When interest focuses on quantiles of functionals of the posterior distribution, we describe an easily-implemented method for determining the total number of iterations required, and also the number of initial iterations that should be discarded to allow for "burn-in". The method uses only the Gibbs iterates themselves, and does not, for example, require external specification of characteristics of the posterior density. Here the method is described for the situation where one long run is generated, but it can also be easily applied if there are several runs from different starting points. It also applies more generally to Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes other than the Gibbs sampler. It can also be used when several quantiles are to be estimated, when the quantities of interest are probabilities rather than full posterior distributions, and when the draws from the posterior distribution are required to be approximately independent. The method is applied to several different posterior distributions. These include},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockade increases the risk of tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to use Markov modeling to examine the contributions of reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) and the progression of new infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis to active TB due to TNF blockade. These 2 pathogenic mechanisms cannot otherwise be readily distinguished. METHODS: Monte Carlo simulation was used to represent the range of reported values for the incidence of TB associated with infliximab (TNF monoclonal antibody) and etanercept (soluble TNF receptor) therapy. Iterative methods were then used to identify for each pair of incidence rates the Markov model parameters that most accurately represented the distribution of time to onset of TB as reported to the Food and Drug Administration. RESULTS: Modeling revealed an apparent median monthly rate of reactivation of LTBI by infliximab treatment of 20.8{\%}, which was 12.1 times that with etanercept treatment (P{\textless}0.001). In contrast, both drugs appeared to pose a high risk of progression of new M tuberculosis infection to active TB. Progression of new infection appeared to cause nearly half of the etanercept-associated cases; it became the predominant cause of infliximab-associated cases only after the first year. CONCLUSION: Despite sharing a common therapeutic target, infliximab and etanercept differ markedly in the rates at which they reactivate LTBI. Confirmation of these findings will require the application of molecular epidemiologic tools to studies of TB in future biologics registries. Hidden Markov modeling and Monte Carlo simulation are powerful tools for revealing otherwise hidden aspects of the pathogenesis of TB.},

Results indicate that for a low bacteria load that is characteristic of latent TB and for small reduction in an immune response, the use of a single drug is capable of curing the infection before the appearance of drug resistance. However, for severe immune deficiency, the use of two drugs will provide a larger time period before the emergence of resistance. Therefore, in this case, two-drugs treatment will be more efficient in controlling the infection.},

abstract = {Epidemic control strategies alter the spread of the disease in the host population. In this paper, we describe and discuss mathematical models that can be used to explore the potential of pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines currently under development in the control of tuberculosis. A model with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for the susceptibles and treatment for the infectives is first presented. The epidemic thresholds known as the basic reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined and stabilities are investigated. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the impact of the vaccines currently under development. The centre manifold theory is used to show the existence of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and that the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is greater than unity. From the study we conclude that the pre-exposure vaccine currently under development coupled with chemoprophylaxis for the latently infected and treatment of infectives is more effective when compared to the post-exposure vaccine currently under development for the latently infected coupled with treatment of the infectives. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {SETTING: Cape Town, South Africa. OBJECTIVE: To compare the diagnostic yield for smear/culture and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF algorithms and to investigate the mechanisms influencing tuberculosis (TB) yield. METHOD: We developed and validated an operational model of the TB diagnostic process, first with the smear/culture algorithm and then with the Xpert algorithm. We modelled scenarios by varying TB prevalence, adherence to diagnostic algorithms and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status. This enabled direct comparisons of diagnostic yield in the two algorithms to be made. RESULTS: Routine data showed that diagnostic yield had decreased over the period of the Xpert algorithm roll-out compared to the yield when the smear/culture algorithm was in place. However, modelling yield under identical conditions indicated a 13.3{\%} increase in diagnostic yield from the Xpert algorithm compared to smear/culture. The model demonstrated that the extensive use of culture in the smear/culture algorithm and the decline in TB prevalence are the main factors contributing to not finding an increase in diagnostic yield in the routine data. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate the benefits of an operational model to determine the effect of scale-up of a new diagnostic algorithm, and recommend that policy makers use operational modelling to make appropriate decisions before new diagnostic algorithms are scaled up.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: This study explored the effect of screening and treatment of refugees for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) before entrance to the United States as a strategy for reducing active tuberculosis (TB). The purpose of this study was to estimate the costs and benefits of LTBI screening and treatment in United States bound refugees prior to arrival. METHODS: Costs were included for foreign and domestic LTBI screening and treatment and the domestic treatment of active TB. A decision tree with multiple Markov nodes was developed to determine the total costs and number of active TB cases that occurred in refugee populations that tested 55, 35, and 20 {\%} tuberculin skin test positive under two models: no overseas LTBI screening and overseas LTBI screening and treatment. For this analysis, refugees that tested 55, 35, and 20 {\%} tuberculin skin test positive were divided into high, moderate, and low LTBI prevalence categories to denote their prevalence of LTBI relative to other refugee populations. RESULTS: For a hypothetical 1-year cohort of 100,000 refugees arriving in the United States from regions with high, moderate, and low LTBI prevalence, implementation of overseas screening would be expected to prevent 440, 220, and 57 active TB cases in the United States during the first 20 years after arrival. The cost savings associated with treatment of these averted cases would offset the cost of LTBI screening and treatment for refugees from countries with high (net cost-saving: {\$}4.9 million) and moderate (net cost-saving: {\$}1.6 million) LTBI prevalence. For low LTBI prevalence populations, LTBI screening and treatment exceed expected future TB treatment cost savings (net cost of {\$}780,000). CONCLUSIONS: Implementing LTBI screening and treatment for United States bound refugees from countries with high or moderate LTBI prevalence would potentially save millions of dollars and contribute to United States TB elimination goals. These estimates are conservative since secondary transmission from tuberculosis cases in the United States was not considered in the model.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a disease that is closely associated with poverty, with transmission occurring in situations where infected persons are in close contact with others in confined spaces. While it is well recognised that overcrowding increases the risk of transmission, this increased risk has not been quantified and the relationship between overcrowding and duration of exposure is not well understood. This paper analyses three epidemiological models that have been used to predict the transmission of airborne disease in confined spaces: the Mass Action model, Riley, Murphy and Riley's model and Gammaitoni and Nucci's model. A study is presented to demonstrate the range of applicability of each model and show how they can be applied to the transmission of both TB and diseases with short incubation periods such as measles. Gammiatoni and Nucci's generalised formulation is shown to be the most suitable for modelling airborne transmission in ventilated spaces, and it is subsequently used in a parametric study to evaluate the effect of physical and environmental factors on the rate of disease transmission. The paper also presents reported quanta production data for several TB outbreaks and demonstrates that the greatest risk of TB infection is during clinical procedures that produce large quantities of aerosol, such as bronchoscopy or intubation.},

abstract = {Transmission of the agent of tuberculosis, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is dependent on social context. A discrete spatial model representing neighborhoods segregated by levels of crowding and immunocompetence is constructed and used to evaluate prevention strategies, based on a number of assumptions about the spatial dynamics of tuberculosis. A cellular automata model is used to (a) construct neighborhoods of different densities, (b) model stochastically local interactions among individuals, and (c) model the spread of tuberculosis within and across neighborhoods over time. Since infected people may become progressively sick but also heal through treatment, the transition among stages was modeled with transition probabilities. A moderate level of successful treatment (40{\%}) dramatically reduced the number of infections across all neighborhoods. Increasing the treatment in neighborhoods of a lower socioeconomic level from 40{\%} to 90{\%} results in an additional decrease of approximately 25{\%} in the number of infected individuals overall. In conclusion, we find that a combination of a moderate level of successful treatment across all areas with more focused treatment efforts in lower socioeconomic areas resulted in the least number of infections over time.},

abstract = {HIV transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by McKay, Conover {\&} Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the LHS uncertainty and the LHS/PRC (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of HIV transmission.},

@article{Gandhi2010,
abstract = {Although progress has been made to reduce global incidence of drug-susceptible tuberculosis, the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis during the past decade threatens to undermine these advances. However, countries are responding far too slowly. Of the estimated 440 000 cases of MDR tuberculosis that occurred in 2008, only 7{\%} were identified and reported to WHO. Of these cases, only a fifth were treated according to WHO standards. Although treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis is possible with currently available diagnostic techniques and drugs, the treatment course is substantially more costly and laborious than for drug-susceptible tuberculosis, with higher rates of treatment failure and mortality. Nonetheless, a few countries provide examples of how existing technologies can be used to reverse the epidemic of MDR tuberculosis within a decade. Major improvements in laboratory capacity, infection control, performance of tuberculosis control programmes, and treatment regimens for both drug-susceptible and drug-resistant disease will be needed, together with a massive scale-up in diagnosis and treatment of MDR and XDR tuberculosis to prevent drug-resistant strains from becoming the dominant form of tuberculosis. New diagnostic tests and drugs are likely to become available during the next few years and should accelerate control of MDR and XDR tuberculosis. Equally important, especially in the highest-burden countries of India, China, and Russia, will be a commitment to tuberculosis control including improvements in national policies and health systems that remove financial barriers to treatment, encourage rational drug use, and create the infrastructure necessary to manage MDR tuberculosis on a national scale. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes conflicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By contrast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resistance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mechanisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms.},

The epidemiology of tuberculous infection and disease during the period 1926–2000 in this population was investigated.Methods The trend in the annual risk of infection (ARI) since 1926 was estimated using tuberculous meningitis mortality statistics and skin testing data. Risks of progression from infection to disease were estimated by fitting model predictions of disease incidence to TB notifications, using maximum likelihood methods. Infectious TB notifications were matched with ARI estimates to obtain the number of transmissions per infectious case over time.Results We estimate that the ARI decreased from more than 10{\%} during the prechemotherapy era to less than 0.1{\%} by 2000. The risks of primary, reactivation, and exogenous re-infection disease among adults aged 25–44 years were 22{\%}, 0.1{\%}, and 6{\%}, respectively. The number of transmissions per infectious case decreased from 16 to 2 from the early 1970s to the late 1990s.Conclusions This study shows that the risk of infection among British Columbia First Nations people is decreasing, while the relative contribution of reactivation to disease incidence is increasing. Once infected, First Nations people may have a higher risk of developing disease than other populations.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify and characterise non-specific immunological effects after routine childhood vaccines against BCG, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. DESIGN Systematic review of randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies. DATA SOURCES Embase, PubMed, Cochrane library, and Trip searched between 1947 and January 2014. Publications submitted by a panel of experts in the specialty were also included. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES All human studies reporting non-specific immunological effects after vaccination with standard childhood immunisations. Studies using recombinant vaccines, no vaccine at all, or reporting only vaccine specific outcomes were excluded. The primary aim was to systematically identify, assemble, and review all available studies and data on the possible non-specific or heterologous immunological effects of BCG; measles; mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR); diphtheria; tetanus; and pertussis vaccines. RESULTS The initial search yielded 11 168 references; 77 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria for data analysis. In most included studies (48{\%}) BCG was the vaccine intervention. The final time point of outcome measurement was primarily performed (70{\%}) between one and 12 months after vaccination. There was a high risk of bias in the included studies, with no single study rated low risk across all assessment criteria. A total of 143 different immunological variables were reported, which, in conjunction with differences in measurement units and summary statistics, created a high number of combinations thus precluding any meta-analysis. Studies that compared BCG vaccinated with unvaccinated groups showed a trend towards increased IFN-$\gamma$ production in vitro in the vaccinated groups. Increases were also observed for IFN-$\gamma$ measured after BCG vaccination in response to in vitro stimulation with microbial antigens from Candida albicans, tetanus toxoid, Staphylococcus aureas, lipopolysaccharide, and hepatitis B. Cohort studies of measles vaccination showed an increase in lymphoproliferation to microbial antigens from tetanus toxoid and C albicans Increases in immunogenicity to heterologous antigens were noted after diphtheria-tetanus (herpes simplex virus and polio antibody titres) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (pneumococcus serotype 14 and polio neutralising responses) vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The papers reporting non-specific immunological effects had heterogeneous study designs and could not be conventionally meta-analysed, providing a low level of evidence quality. Some studies, such as BCG vaccine studies examining in vitro IFN-$\gamma$ responses and measles vaccine studies examining lymphoproliferation to microbial antigen stimulation, showed a consistent direction of effect suggestive of non-specific immunological effects. The quality of the evidence, however, does not provide confidence in the nature, magnitude, or timing of non-specific immunological effects after vaccination with BCG, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, or measles containing vaccines nor the clinical importance of the findings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign-born persons in Canada contribute 67{\%} of all tuberculosis (TB) cases annually, but represent only 21{\%} of the total population. Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that most foreign-born TB cases result from the reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. OBJECTIVE : To estimate the effect on incidence of a prevention strategy that would screen selected immigrants at arrival for LTBI and offer preventive treatment to those who test positive. DESIGN: A deterministic model was developed to quantify the incidence of active TB in immigrants to Canada and validated with national immigration and TB case data. RESULTS : Model simulations suggested that it would be optimal to screen and treat LTBI in new immigrants from countries of birth with an estimated TB incidence rate in excess of 50 per 100 000 person-years. If this strategy had been implemented in 1986, the national TB incidence rate would have fallen by 18.5{\%}, from 5.4 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 population by 2002. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that screening and treating LTBI in foreign-born persons from high TB incidence countries is the most effective strategy in terms of total persons screened and treated and percentage reduction in national incidence. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Union.},

In the case of tuberculosis (TB), such models have informed our understanding and control strategies for over 40 years, but the primary assumptions of these models--and their most urgent data needs--remain obscure to many TB researchers and control officers. The structure and parameter values of TB models are informed by observational studies and experiments, but the evidence base in support of these models remains incomplete. Speaking from the perspective of infectious disease modelers addressing the broader TB research and control communities, we describe the basic structure common to most TB models and present a 'wish list' that would improve the evidence foundation upon which these models are built. As a comprehensive TB research agenda is formulated, we argue that the data needs of infectious disease models--our primary long-term decision-making tools--should figure prominently.},

@article{Cohen2007,
abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis leads to tuberculosis (TB) disease by one of the three possible routes: primary progression after a recent infection; re-activation of a latent infection; or exogenous re-infection of a previously infected individual. Recent studies show that optimal TB control strategies may vary depending on the predominant route to disease in a specific population. It is therefore important for public health policy makers to understand the relative frequency of each type of TB within specific epidemiological scenarios. Although molecular epidemiologic tools have been used to estimate the relative contribution of recent transmission and re-activation to the burden of TB disease, it is not possible to use these techniques to distinguish between primary disease and re-infection on a population level. Current estimates of the contribution of re-infection therefore rely on mathematical models which identify the parameters most consistent with epidemiological data; these studies find that exogenous re-infection is important only when TB incidence is high. A basic assumption of these models is that people in a population are all equally likely to come into contact with an infectious case. However, theoretical studies demonstrate that the social and spatial structure can strongly influence the dynamics of infectious disease transmission. Here, we use a network model of TB transmission to evaluate the impact of non-homogeneous mixing on the relative contribution of re-infection over realistic epidemic trajectories. In contrast to the findings of previous models, our results suggest that re-infection may be important in communities where the average disease incidence is moderate or low as the force of infection can be unevenly distributed in the population. These results have important implications for the development of TB control strategies.},

The inclusion of more realistic descriptions of the recovery process is shown to cause a significant destabilization of the model. When there is seasonal variation in discase transmission this destabilization leads to the appearance of complex dynamical patterns with much lower levels of seasonality than previously predicted.

abstract = {The aim of partitioning biodiversity within an ecosystem is to identify dissimilarities in the species compositions of its constituent communities, but current approaches lack the critically important ability to account for similarities among species. Any new approach to diversity analysis must not only satisfy theoretical concerns, but also enable us to carry out real-world tasks such as fairly comparing different aspects of the biodiversity of communities, understanding how the community structure changes over time, and helping to identify the mechanisms that drive these processes. We propose new measures of alpha and beta diversity, sensitive to species similarity, that emerge naturally from recent similarity-sensitive gamma diversity measures. Our key advance is the decomposition of all three of these diversity measures into components reflecting the uniqueness of each community within the ecosystem, and their relative contributions to total ecosystem diversity. These provide powerful tools to reveal biologically important communities within an ecosystem, to assess the spatial and temporal variation in diversity, and to thereby identify the ecosystem's true underlying community structure and dynamics.},

A TB model that considers the existence of a new class (mainly in the African context) is considered: the lost to follow up individuals. Based on the model formulated and studied in the work of Plaire Tchinda Mouofo, (2009), the TB control is formulated and solved as an optimal control theory problem using the Pontryagin's maximum principle (Pontryagin et al., 1992). This control strategy indicates how the control of the lost to follow up class can considerably influence the basic reproduction ratio so as to reduce the number of lost to follow up.

abstract = {Four distinct serotypes of dengue virus co-circulate in many parts of the world. Antibodies to one serotype prevent infection with the homologous serotype, but may enhance infections with heterologous serotypes. Enhanced secondary infections have been implicated in the majority of severe cases, termed dengue hemorrhagic fever. Conventionally, mathematical models assume that all heterologous secondary infections are subject to enhanced susceptibility or transmissibility. However, empirical data show that only a minority of secondary infections lead to severe disease, which suggests that only a minority of secondary infections are subject to enhancement. We present a new modelling framework in which the population susceptible to secondary infection is split into a group prone to enhanced infection and a group with some degree of cross-protection. We use this framework to re-evaluate the role of enhanced infections in several well known dengue models that exhibit multi-annual epidemiological oscillations. We show that enhancement is unlikely to be driving such oscillations but may be modifying the effects of other drivers. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.},

The model presented in this work, describes the dynamic of 4 individuals groups: susceptibles, never before infected; latently-infected or cured of TB under chemotherapy; infectious individuals with pulmonary TB and sputum smear positive; and noninfectious with pulmonary TB but sputum-smear negative or extra-pulmonary TB. Individuals, who complete treatment successfull, are cured of tuberculosis but remain infected and individuals, who do not complete treatment, continue with the illness (infectious or noninfectious). The model, as considered here allows us to evaluate the effect of improve cure rates and case detection.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To inform the choice of an appropriate screening and diagnostic algorithm for tuberculosis (TB) screening initiatives in different epidemiological settings, we compare algorithms composed of currently available methods. METHODS: Of twelve algorithms composed of screening for symptoms (prolonged cough or any TB symptom) and/or chest radiography abnormalities, and either sputum-smear microscopy (SSM) or Xpert MTB/RIF (XP) as confirmatory test we model algorithm outcomes and summarize the yield, number needed to screen (NNS) and positive predictive value (PPV) for different levels of TB prevalence. RESULTS: Screening for prolonged cough has low yield, 22{\%} if confirmatory testing is by SSM and 32{\%} if XP, and a high NNS, exceeding 1000 if TB prevalence is {\textless}/=0.5{\%}. Due to low specificity the PPV of screening for any TB symptom followed by SSM is less than 50{\%}, even if TB prevalence is 2{\%}. CXR screening for TB abnormalities followed by XP has the highest case detection (87{\%}) and lowest NNS, but is resource intensive. CXR as a second screen for symptom screen positives improves efficiency. CONCLUSIONS: The ideal algorithm does not exist. The choice will be setting specific, for which this study provides guidance. Generally an algorithm composed of CXR screening followed by confirmatory testing with XP can achieve the lowest NNS and highest PPV, and is the least amenable to setting-specific variation. However resource requirements for tests and equipment may be prohibitive in some settings and a reason to opt for symptom screening and SSM. To better inform disease control programs we need empirical data to confirm the modeled yield, cost-effectiveness studies, transmission models and a better screening test.},

abstract = {Identifying biomarkers for tuberculosis (TB) is an ongoing challenge in developing immunological correlates of infection outcome and protection. Biomarker discovery is also necessary for aiding design and testing of new treatments and vaccines. To effectively predict biomarkers for infection progression in any disease, including TB, large amounts of experimental data are required to reach statistical power and make accurate predictions. We took a two-pronged approach using both experimental and computational modeling to address this problem. We first collected 200 blood samples over a 2- year period from 28 non-human primates (NHP) infected with a low dose of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We identified T cells and the cytokines that they were producing (single and multiple) from each sample along with monkey status and infection progression data. Machine learning techniques were used to interrogate the experimental NHP datasets without identifying any potential TB biomarker. In parallel, we used our extensive novel NHP datasets to build and calibrate a multi-organ computational model that combines what is occurring at the site of infection (e.g., lung) at a single granuloma scale with blood level readouts that can be tracked in monkeys and humans. We then generated a large in silico repository of in silico granulomas coupled to lymph node and blood dynamics and developed an in silico tool to scale granuloma level results to a full host scale to identify what best predicts Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection outcomes. The analysis of in silico blood measures identifies Mtb-specific frequencies of effector T cell phenotypes at various time points post infection as promising indicators of infection outcome. We emphasize that pairing wetlab and computational approaches holds great promise to accelerate TB biomarker discovery.},

abstract = {Given an adequate definition of the disease problem in epidemiological terms, it is possible to measure the epidemiological effectiveness of control measures in terms of problem reduction. This is to be distinguished from the clinical efficacy of the same measures. The practical difficulty in assessing the epidemiological effectiveness of control measures experimentally can be overcome by the construction of simulation models and the use of computers, whereby the problem reduction associated with various control strategies can be estimated numerically.By varying the levels of certain parameters of the model systematically, the sensitivity of the effectiveness of control measures to the epidemiological, operational, clinical and social parameters of a situation can be assessed. A series of articles analysing this relationship is under preparation. This first article analyses the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of the chemotherapy of tuberculosis to changes in the coverage of the eligible population groups. A previously formulated postulate stating that the marginal effectiveness of these measures decreases as their coverage increases is validated by this first series of simulations. The significance of this finding for planning national tuberculosis control strategies is discussed, as well as possible bias in the method applied.},

abstract = {SETTING: England and Wales. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude and trend in the annual risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1901. DESIGN: Estimates for the prechemotherapy era are derived assuming that 1{\%} of new infections among 0-4 year olds led to fatal tuberculosis meningitis, as found in the Netherlands. The estimates are validated against data from the 1949-1950 national tuberculin survey. We explore the trend thereafter using tuberculous meningitis notifications and data from the 1971-1973 national tuberculin survey, and discuss the utility of data collected under the national bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination scheme for estimating the annual risk of infection. RESULTS: Tuberculosis meningitis mortality rates among 0-4 year olds declined at 4{\%} per annum until 1950, and suggest that the annual risk of infection declined from 12{\%} in 1901 to 1.9{\%} in 1949. The decline in the annual risk of infection probably accelerated in 1950, although its magnitude cannot be determined accurately. CONCLUSION: An accelerated decline in the annual risk of infection in England and Wales from 1950 probably resulted from the introduction of chemotherapy, which dramatically reduced the prevalence of sources of infection in the population. Data collected during the national BCG vaccination scheme were found to be unsuitable for estimating infection risks.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

@article{Sutherland1982,
abstract = {Information on the risk of tuberculous infection in the Netherlands has been linked with information on the incidence of tuberculosis, in an attempt to estimate the risks of developing the disease following infection or reinfection. It was postulated that: (a) those with a recent primary infection had a characteristic risk of developing progressive primary tuberculosis; (b) those with a distant (i.e. not recent) primary infection and a recent reinfection had a characteristic risk of developing exogenous tuberculosis; and (c) those with a distant primary infection but no recent reinfection had a characteristic risk of developing endogenous tuberculosis. The information on the risk of tuberculous infection was used to estimate the size of the population in each of these infection classes for different age-groups and calendar years in the Netherlands. Using multiple regression to link these population figures with the information on tuberculosis incidence in the same age group and calendar year, it was possible to estimate the above risks of developing tuberculosis. For Netherlands males aged 15-69 years during the period 1951-70 the three risks of developing pulmonary tuberculosis were estimated to be: (a) 5.06 per cent annually (for 5 years) following primary infection; (b) 1.91 per cent annually (for 5 years) following reinfection; (c) 0.0253 per cent annually, after the first 5 years following primary infection, in the absence of reinfection. The corresponding (and significantly different) estimated annual risks of development of pulmonary tuberculosis for females were 5.85, 1.10 and 0.0020 per cent respectively. From these risks, it may be estimated that the degree of protection conferred by a distant primary infection, against pulmonary tuberculosis arising from a recent reinfection, was 63 per cent for males and 81 per cent for females. The estimated relative proportions of cases of progressive primary, exogenous and endogenous tuberculosis varied considerably with age and calendar year. Progressive primary tuberculosis was dominant at the younger ages, exogenous and endogenous tuberculosis at older ages. At these older ages, the great majority of cases in the Netherlands in the early 1950s appeared to be exogenous in origin, but by 1970, with the decrease in the risk of infection, the exogenous contribution had dwindled substantially, especially among males.},

A computational model of this interaction network, which encodes complex interplay among host and bacterial components, forms a useful basis for improving the understanding of pathogenesis, in filling knowledge gaps and consequently to identify strategies to counter the disease. We have built an extensive model of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis host-pathogen interactome, consisting of 75 nodes corresponding to host and pathogen molecules, cells, cellular states or processes. Vaccination effects, clearance efficiencies due to drugs and growth rates have also been encoded in the model. The system is modelled as a Boolean network. Virtual deletion experiments, multiple parameter scans and analysis of the system's response to perturbations, indicate that disabling processes such as phagocytosis and phagolysosome fusion or cytokines such as TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, greatly impaired bacterial clearance, while removing cytokines such as IL-10 alongside bacterial defence proteins such as SapM greatly favour clearance. Simulations indicate a high propensity of the pathogen to persist under different conditions.},

@article{Lim2001,
abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The prompt diagnosis of smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is a clinical challenge. It may be achieved by a number of tests which have varying accuracies, costs and degrees of invasiveness. The objective of this study was to compare the cost-effectiveness of clinical judgement (empirical), the Roche Cobas amplicor assay for Mycobacterium tuberculosis (amplicor), acid-fast staining of bronchoalveolar lavage specimens (BAL), nucleic acid amplification tests of bronchoalveloar lavage specimens for M. tuberculosis (BAL + NAA), computed tomography (CT) and amplicor assay followed by BAL. METHODOLOGY: The range of predictive values of the various strategies were derived from published data and a new study of 441 consecutive adult patients with suspected smear-negative PTB prospectively stratified into three pretest risk groups: low, intermediate and high. The cost-effectiveness was evaluated with a decision tree model (DATA software). RESULTS: The incidence of PTB was 5.7{\%} (4{\%} culture positive) for the whole group, 95{\%} in the high-risk group, 0.9{\%} in the low-risk group and 3.4{\%} in the intermediate-risk group. The sensitivity of the empirical approach was 49{\%} and of the amplicor assay was 44{\%}. Patient outcomes were expressed as life expectancy for the base case of a 58-year-old man with a pretest probability of 5.7{\%}. At this low pretest risk the differences in life expectancies between tests was {\textless} 0.1 years and the empirical approach incurred the lowest cost. Sensitivity analysis at increasing pretest risks showed better life expectancies (approximately 1 years) for CT scan and test combinations than empirical and amplicor for additional costs of US{\$}243-US{\$}309. Bronchoalveolar lavage had the worst overall cost-effectiveness. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the pretest risk of active PTB was a key determinant of test utility; that the AMPLICOR assay was comparable to clinical judgement; that BAL was the least useful test; and that with increasing risks, CT scan and test combinations performed better. Further studies are needed to better define patients with intermediate risk for PTB and to directly compare the cost-effectiveness of more sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests such as the enhanced Gen Probe, CT scan and test combinations/sequences in these patients.},

abstract = {SETTING: Bedaquiline (BDQ) has been approved in India for the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB), but is currently recommended for MDR-TB patients who have failed initial treatment with standard regimens. While some have argued that such deferred BDQ use allows a second line of defense with a potent drug, this strategy may not be optimal. OBJECTIVE: To compare several distinct scenarios of BDQ access and use, and their potential impact on the MDR-TB disease burden and the associated net economic benefit in India. METHOD: We used a state-transition model to carry out this evaluation. The scenarios differed in the timing and breadth of BDQ access. RESULTS: The simulations showed that a strategy reliant on reserving the use of BDQ for those who have failed other MDR-TB regimens is likely to result in worse treatment outcomes for patients and in inferior public health outcomes for communities, leading to reduced net monetary benefit. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that deferring patient access to new drugs such as BDQ until front-line regimens have failed, in order to 'save' these drugs for later use, could be detrimental to patients and to public health, and could reduce the economic benefit of treating MDR-TB.},

abstract = {In the last 60 years, great progress has been made in controlling and preventing tuberculosis in China. However, the number of tuberculosis cases has increased dramatically in the last 25 years, mainly due to the lack of effective control measures of immigrating populations with tuberculosis. In order to explore the effective control and prevention measures we propose a deterministic model to study the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in Guangdong province of China in this paper. The model consists of susceptible, exposed and infectious recovered subpopulations of immigrating populations from other provinces and the local population of Guangdong. We obtain the effective reproduction number. Based on the analysis, we also establish an optimal immune programming model, and get the optimal proportion of vaccine coverage with control of the effective reproduction number. Simulation is used to determine the validation and reliability. Our study demonstrates that the immigrating population from different provinces needs to be vaccinated according to the incidence rate of TB in their original provinces, and it is an effective way to prevent the outbreak of tuberculosis in Guangdong.},

Here we review and compare the mathematical models of tuberculosis dynamics in the literature. We present two models of our own: a spatial stochastic individual-based model and a set of delay differential equations encapsulating the same biological assumptions.

We argue that seemingly subtle differences in model assumptions can have significant effects on biological conclusions.},

abstract = {Although different structures are used in modern tuberculosis (TB) models to simulate TB latency, it remains unclear whether they are all capable of reproducing the particular activation dynamics empirically observed. We aimed to determine which of these structures replicate the dynamics of progression accurately. We reviewed 88 TB-modelling articles and classified them according to the latency structure employed. We then fitted these different models to the activation dynamics observed from 1352 infected contacts diagnosed in Victoria (Australia) and Amsterdam (Netherlands) to obtain parameter estimates. Six different model structures were identified, of which only those incorporating two latency compartments were capable of reproducing the activation dynamics empirically observed. We found important differences in parameter estimates by age. We also observed marked differences between our estimates and the parameter values used in many previous models. In particular, when two successive latency phases are considered, the first period should have a duration that is much shorter than that used in previous studies. In conclusion, structures incorporating two latency compartments and age-stratification should be employed to accurately replicate the dynamics of TB latency. We provide a catalogue of parameter values and an approach to parameter estimation from empiric data for calibration of future TB-models.},

@article{Salpeter1998,
abstract = {The authors used epidemiologic data on tuberculosis to construct a model for the time delay from initial latent infection to active disease, when infection transmission occurs. They used case rate tables in the United States to calculate the fractional rate of change per annum (A) in the incidence of active tuberculosis. They then derived estimates for the effective reproductive number (R) and the cumulative transmission, defined as the number of people whom one infected person will infect in his or her lifetime and over many multiple successive transmissions, respectively. For A of -4 percent per year, the average US condition from 1930 to 1995, they estimate the reproductive number to be about 0.55 and the cumulative transmission to be about 1.2. The estimated rate of the new latent infections in the United States is 80,000 per year, the estimated prevalence of latent infections is 5 percent, and the number of transmissions of infection per active case is 3.5. From the model, the authors predicted active case rates in various age groups and compared them with published tables. The comparison suggests that the risk of activation decreases rapidly, then gradually, for the first 10 years after initial infection; the risk is relatively constant from 10 to 40 years and may decrease again after 40 years. The authors also discuss how this model can be used to help make decisions about tuberculosis control measures in the population.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The economic burden on households affected by tuberculosis through costs to patients can be catastrophic. WHO's End TB Strategy recognises and aims to eliminate these potentially devastating economic effects. We assessed whether aggressive expansion of tuberculosis services might reduce catastrophic costs. METHODS: We estimated the reduction in tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs with an aggressive expansion of tuberculosis services in India and South Africa from 2016 to 2035, in line with the End TB Strategy. Using modelled incidence and mortality for tuberculosis and patient-incurred cost estimates, we investigated three intervention scenarios: improved treatment of drug-sensitive tuberculosis; improved treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis; and expansion of access to tuberculosis care through intensified case finding (South Africa only). We defined tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs as the sum of direct medical, direct non-medical, and indirect costs to patients exceeding 20{\%} of total annual household income. Intervention effects were quantified as changes in the number of households incurring catastrophic costs and were assessed by quintiles of household income. FINDINGS: In India and South Africa, improvements in treatment for drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis could reduce the number of households incurring tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs by 6-19{\%}. The benefits would be greatest for the poorest households. In South Africa, expanded access to care could decrease household tuberculosis-related catastrophic costs by 5-20{\%}, but gains would be seen largely after 5-10 years. INTERPRETATION: Aggressive expansion of tuberculosis services in India and South Africa could lessen, although not eliminate, the catastrophic financial burden on affected households.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Routinely collected data from tuberculosis surveillance system can be used to investigate and monitor the irregularities and abrupt changes of the disease incidence. We aimed at using a Hidden Markov Model in order to detect the abnormal states of pulmonary tuberculosis in Iran. METHODS: Data for this study were the weekly number of newly diagnosed cases with sputum smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis reported between April 2005 and March 2011 throughout Iran. In order to detect the unusual states of the disease, two Hidden Markov Models were applied to the data with and without seasonal trends as baselines. Consequently, the best model was selected and compared with the results of Serfling epidemic threshold which is typically used in the surveillance of infectious diseases. RESULTS: Both adjusted R-squared and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) reflected better goodness-of-fit for the model with seasonal trends (0.72 and -1336.66, respectively) than the model without seasonality (0.56 and -1386.75). Moreover, according to the Serfling epidemic threshold, higher values of sensitivity and specificity suggest a higher validity for the seasonal model (0.87 and 0.94, respectively) than model without seasonality (0.73 and 0.68, respectively). CONCLUSION: A two-state Hidden Markov Model along with a seasonal trend as a function of the model parameters provides an effective warning system for the surveillance of tuberculosis.},

Basic examples of these communities are prisons, but certain urban/rural communities, some schools, among others could possibly fit well into this definition. These communities present a sort of ideal conditions for TB spread. In order to describe key relevant dynamics of the disease in these communities, we consider a five compartments SEIR model with five possible routes toward TB infection: primary infection after a contact with infected and infectious individuals (fast TB), endogenous reactivation after a period of latency (slow TB), relapse by natural causes after a cure, exogenous reinfection of latently infected, and exogenous reinfection of recovered individuals. We discuss the possible existence of multiple endemic equilibrium states and the role that the two types of exogenous reinfections in the long-term dynamics of the disease could play.},

Judgments about the true scale of the problem, and strategies for containing it, need to come from a balanced appraisal of the epidemiological evidence. We conclude in this review that MDR is, and will probably remain, a locally severe problem; that epidemics can be prevented by fully exploiting the potential of standard short-course chemotherapy (SCC) based on cheap and safe first-line drugs; and that best-practice SCC may even reduce the incidence of MDR where it has already become endemic. On the basis of the available, imperfect data, we recommend a three-part response to the threat of MDR: widespread implementation of SCC as the cornerstone of good tuberculosis control, improved resistance testing and surveillance, and the careful introduction of second-line drugs after a sound evaluation of cost, effectiveness, and feasibility.},

abstract = {Background: Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death in South Africa. The burden of disease varies by age, with peaks in TB notification rates in the HIV-negative population at ages 0-5, 20-24, and 45-49 years. There is little variation between age groups in the rates in the HIV-positive population. The drivers of this age pattern remain unknown. Methods: We developed an age-structured simulation model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) transmission in Cape Town, South Africa. We considered five states of TB progression: susceptible, infected (latent TB), active TB, treated TB, and treatment default. Latently infected individuals could be re-infected; a previous Mtb infection slowed progression to active disease. We further considered three states of HIV progression: HIV negative, HIV positive, on antiretroviral therapy. To parameterize the model, we analysed treatment outcomes from the Cape Town electronic TB register, social mixing patterns from a Cape Town community and used literature estimates for other parameters. To investigate the main drivers behind the age patterns, we conducted sensitivity analyses on all parameters related to the age structure. Results: The model replicated the age patterns in HIV-negative TB notification rates of Cape Town in 2009. Simulated TB notification rate in HIV-negative patients was 1000/100,000 person-years (pyrs) in children aged {\textless}5 years and decreased to 51/100,000 in children 5-15 years. The peak in early adulthood occurred at 25-29 years (463/100,000 pyrs). After a subsequent decline, simulated TB notification rates gradually increased from the age of 30 years. Sensitivity analyses showed that the dip after the early adult peak was due to the protective effect of latent TB and that retreatment TB was mainly responsible for the rise in TB notification rates from the age of 30 years. Conclusion: The protective effect of a first latent infection on subsequent infections and the faster progression in previously treated patients are the key determinants of the age-structure of TB notification rates in Cape Town.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In response to rising TB notification rates in England, universal strain typing was introduced in 2010. We evaluated the acceptability, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the TB strain typing service (TB-STS). METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods evaluation using routine laboratory, clinic and public health data. We estimated the effect of the TB-STS on detection of false positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis diagnoses (2010-2012); contact tracing yield (number of infections or active disease per pulmonary TB case); and diagnostic delay. We developed a deterministic age-structured compartmental model to explore the effectiveness of the TB-STS, which informed a cost-effectiveness analysis. RESULTS: Semi-structured interviews explored user experience. Strain typing identified 17 additional false positive diagnoses. The TB-STS had no significant effect on contact tracing yield or diagnostic delay. Mathematical modelling suggested increasing the proportion of infections detected would have little value in reducing TB incidence in the white UK-born population. However, in the non-white UK-born and non-UK-born populations, over 20 years, if detection of latent infection increases from 3{\%} to 13{\%} per year, then TB incidence would decrease by 11{\%}; reducing diagnostic delay by one week could lead to 25{\%} reduction in incidence. The current TB-STS was not predicted to be cost-effective over 20 years ( pound95 628/quality-adjusted life-years). Interviews found people had mixed experiences, but identified broader benefits, of the TB-STS. CONCLUSIONS: To reduce costs, improve efficiency and increase effectiveness, we recommend changes to the TB-STS, including discontinuing routine cluster investigations and focusing on reducing diagnostic delay across the TB programme. This evaluation of a complex intervention informs the future of strain typing in the era of rapidly advancing technologies.},

abstract = {This study estimated to what extent tuberculosis transmission in the Netherlands depends on the age and sex of source cases. DNA fingerprints of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates were matched to patient information in the Netherlands Tuberculosis Register for 1993-1998. Clusters were defined as groups of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis whose isolates had identical DNA fingerprints. Source cases were assigned by using two models. The first-case model assumed that the first diagnosed case was the source case. The incidence rate model estimated source case probabilities from the incidence rates of potential source cases and the time of diagnosis. DNA fingerprints of 6,102 isolates were matched to patient information on 5,080 (83{\%}) cases, 3,479 of whom had pulmonary disease. According to both models, the number of infectious cases generated per source case was lower for female than for male source cases and decreased with increasing age of the source case. The authors concluded that transmission of tuberculosis is associated with the age and sex of source cases as well as the age of secondary cases. Increased transmission among immigrant groups in the Netherlands is largely attributable to the relatively young age of immigrant source cases.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) techniques permit inferences in complex demographic models, but are computationally inefficient. A Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach has been proposed (Marjoram et al. 2003), but it suffers from computational problems and poor mixing. We propose several methodological developments to overcome the shortcomings of this MCMC approach and hence realize substantial computational advances over standard ABC. The principal idea is to relax the tolerance within MCMC to permit good mixing, but retain a good approximation to the posterior by a combination of subsampling the output and regression adjustment. We also propose to use a partial least-squares (PLS) transformation to choose informative statistics. The accuracy of our approach is examined in the case of the divergence of two populations with and without migration. In that case, our ABC-MCMC approach needs considerably lower computation time to reach the same accuracy than conventional ABC. We then apply our method to a more complex case with the estimation of divergence times and migration rates between three African populations.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The potential epidemiological impact of isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT), delivered at levels that could be feasibly scaled up among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in modern, moderate-burden settings, remains uncertain. METHODS: We used routine surveillance and implementation data from a cluster-randomized trial of IPT among HIV-infected clinic patients with good access to antiretroviral therapy in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, to populate a parsimonious transmission model of tuberculosis (TB)/HIV. We modeled IPT delivery as a constant process capturing a proportion of the eligible population every year. We projected feasible reductions in TB incidence and mortality in the general population and among PLHIV specifically at the end of 5 years after implementing an IPT program. RESULTS: Data on time to IPT fit an exponential curve well, suggesting that IPT was delivered at a rate covering 20{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval: 16{\%} to 24{\%}) of the 2500 eligible individuals each year. By the end of year 5 after modeled program rollout, IPT had reduced TB incidence by 3.0{\%} [95{\%} uncertainty range (UR): 1.6{\%} to 7.2{\%}] in the general population and by 15.6{\%} (95{\%} UR: 15.5{\%} to 36.5{\%}) among PLHIV. Corresponding reductions in TB mortality were 4.0{\%} (95{\%} UR: 2.2{\%} to 10.3{\%}) and 14.3{\%} (14.6{\%} to 33.7{\%}). Results were robust to wide variations in parameter values on sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSIONS: TB screening and IPT delivery can substantially reduce TB incidence and mortality among PLHIV in urban, moderate-burden settings. In such settings, IPT can be an important component of a multi-faceted strategy to feasibly reduce the burden of TB in PLHIV.},

abstract = {While there is good evidence linking animal introductions to impacts on native communities via disease emergence, our understanding ofhowsuch impacts occur is incomplete. Invasion ecologists have focused on the disease risks to native communities through ‘‘spillover'' of infectious agents introduced with nonindigenous hosts, while overlooking a potentially more common mechanism of impact, that of ‘‘parasite spillback.'' We hypothesize that parasite spillback could occur when a nonindigenous species is a competent host for a native parasite, with the presence of the additional host increasing disease impacts in native species. Despite its lack of formalization in all recent reviews of the role of parasites in species introductions, aspects of the invasion process actually favor parasite spillback over spillover.Wespecifically review the animal-parasite literature and show that native species (arthropods, parasitoids, protozoa, and helminths) account for 67{\%} of the parasite fauna of nonindigenous animals from a range of taxonomic groups. Weshow that nonindigenous species can be highly competent hosts for such parasites and provide evidence that infection by native parasites does spillback from nonindigenous species to native host species, with effects at both the host individual and population scale. We conclude by calling for greater recognition of parasite spillback as a potential threat to native species, discuss possible reasons for its neglect by invasion ecologists, and identify future research directions.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: India has announced a goal of universal access to quality tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis and treatment. A number of novel diagnostics could help meet this important goal. The rollout of one such diagnostic, Xpert MTB/RIF (Xpert) is being considered, but if Xpert is used mainly for people with HIV or high risk of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) in the public sector, population-level impact may be limited. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a model of TB transmission, care-seeking behavior, and diagnostic/treatment practices in India and explored the impact of six different rollout strategies. Providing Xpert to 40{\%} of public-sector patients with HIV or prior TB treatment (similar to current national strategy) reduced TB incidence by 0.2{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty range [UR]: -1.4{\%}, 1.7{\%}) and MDR-TB incidence by 2.4{\%} (95{\%} UR: -5.2{\%}, 9.1{\%}) relative to existing practice but required 2,500 additional MDR-TB treatments and 60 four-module GeneXpert systems at maximum capacity. Further including 20{\%} of unselected symptomatic individuals in the public sector required 700 systems and reduced incidence by 2.1{\%} (95{\%} UR: 0.5{\%}, 3.9{\%}); a similar approach involving qualified private providers (providers who have received at least some training in allopathic or non-allopathic medicine) reduced incidence by 6.0{\%} (95{\%} UR: 3.9{\%}, 7.9{\%}) with similar resource outlay, but only if high treatment success was assured. Engaging 20{\%} of all private-sector providers (qualified and informal [providers with no formal medical training]) had the greatest impact (14.1{\%} reduction, 95{\%} UR: 10.6{\%}, 16.9{\%}), but required {\textgreater}2,200 systems and reliable treatment referral. Improving referrals from informal providers for smear-based diagnosis in the public sector (without Xpert rollout) had substantially greater impact (6.3{\%} reduction) than Xpert scale-up within the public sector. These findings are subject to substantial uncertainty regarding private-sector treatment patterns, patient care-seeking behavior, symptoms, and infectiousness over time; these uncertainties should be addressed by future research. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of new diagnostics for TB control in India depends on implementation within the complex, fragmented health-care system. Transformative strategies will require private/informal-sector engagement, adequate referral systems, improved treatment quality, and substantial resources.

Automated calculation of appropriate convergence and sample length diagnostics, user-friendly access to commonly used graphical outputs and summary statistics, and parallelized methods of running JAGS are provided. Template model specifications can be generated using a standard lme4-style formula interface to assist users less familiar with the BUGS syntax. Automated simulation study functions are implemented to facilitate model performance assessment, as well as drop-k type cross-validation studies, using high performance computing clusters such as those provided by parallel. A module extension for JAGS is also included within runjags, providing the Pareto family of distributions and a series of minimally-informative priors including the DuMouchel and half-Cauchy priors. This paper outlines the primary functions of this package, and gives an illustration of a simulation study to assess the sensitivity of two equivalent model formulations to different prior distributions.},

In a sense which becomes apparent, these measures provide estimates of the effective number of species present, and differ only in their tendency to include or to ignore the relatively rarer species. The notion of the diversity of a community as opposed to that of a sample is examined, and is related to the asymptotic form of the species—abundance curve.

In the context of increasingly constrained resources, mathematical modelling can augment understanding and support policy for implementing those strategies that are most likely to bring public health and economic benefits. In this paper, we present an overview of past and recent contributions of TB modelling in this key area, and suggest a way forward through a modelling research agenda that supports a more effective response to the TB-HIV epidemic, based on expert discussions at a meeting convened by the TB Modelling and Analysis Consortium. The research agenda identified high-priority areas for future modelling efforts, including 1) the difficult diagnosis and high mortality of TB-HIV; 2) the high risk of disease progression; 3) TB health systems in high HIV prevalence settings; 4) uncertainty in the natural progression of TB-HIV; and 5) combined interventions for TB-HIV. Efficient and rapid progress towards completion of this modelling agenda will require co-ordination between the modelling community and key stakeholders, including advocates, health policy makers, donors and national or regional finance officials. A continuing dialogue will ensure that new results are effectively communicated and new policy-relevant questions are addressed swiftly.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a common lethal infectious disease usually caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. According to the WHO, TB to date, claims the second largest number of victims due to a single infectious agent right after HIV/AIDS. Although a widespread implementation of control measures focus on case finding and short-course chemotherapy, the global burden of TB has increased over the past two decades. A deterministic TB model with a demographic structure for the population living in a multi-patch environment (cities, towns, regions or countries, etc.) is formulated. The basic reproduction number R-0 is computed. A sensitivity analysis of the model parameters is performed to estimate the most influential parameters in TB dynamics. Using the iterative Gauss-Newton method to solve the inverse problem of parameter identification, estimability of parameters have been studied, and estimable unknown parameters have been computed using real data of TB in Cameroon, subdivided into four regions. Numerical simulations showed the model to reproduce the TB dynamics in Cameroon and predict a short term increase in the number of TB active cases over next years.},

abstract = {Accuracy of results from mathematical and computer models of biological systems is often complicated by the presence of uncertainties in experimental data that are used to estimate parameter values. Current mathematical modeling approaches typically use either single-parameter or local sensitivity analyses. However, these methods do not accurately assess uncertainty and sensitivity in the system as, by default they hold all other parameters fixed at baseline values. Using techniques described within we demonstrate how a multi-dimensional parameter space can be studied globally so all uncertainties can be identified. Further, uncertainty and sensitivity analysis techniques can help to identify and ultimately control uncertainties. In this work we develop methods for applying existing analytical tools to perform analyses on a variety of mathematical and computer models. We compare two specific types of global sensitivity analysis indexes that have proven to be among the most robust and efficient. Through familiar and new examples of mathematical and computer models, we provide a complete methodology for performing these analyses, both in deterministic and stochastic settings, and propose novel techniques to handle problems encountered during this type of analyses.},

abstract = {The ongoing explosion of antibiotic-resistant infections continues to plague global and US health care. Meanwhile, an equally alarming decline has occurred in the research and development of new antibiotics to deal with the threat. In response to this microbial "perfect storm," in 2001, the federal Interagency Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance released the "Action Plan to Combat Antimicrobial Resistance; Part 1: Domestic" to strengthen the response in the United States. The Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) followed in 2004 with its own report, "Bad Bugs, No Drugs: As Antibiotic Discovery Stagnates, A Public Health Crisis Brews," which proposed incentives to reinvigorate pharmaceutical investment in antibiotic research and development. The IDSA's subsequent lobbying efforts led to the introduction of promising legislation in the 109 th US Congress (January 2005-December 2006). Unfortunately, the legislation was not enacted. During the 110 th Congress, the IDSA has continued to work with congressional leaders on promising legislation to address antibiotic-resistant infection. Nevertheless, despite intensive public relations and lobbying efforts, it remains unclear whether sufficiently robust legislation will be enacted. In the meantime, microbes continue to become more resistant, the antibiotic pipeline continues to diminish, and the majority of the public remains unaware of this critical situation. The result of insufficient federal funding; insufficient surveillance, prevention, and control; insufficient research and development activities; misguided regulation of antibiotics in agriculture and, in particular, for food animals; and insufficient overall coordination of US (and international) efforts could mean a literal return to the preantibiotic era for many types of infections. If we are to address the antimicrobial resistance crisis, a concerted, grassroots effort led by the medical community will be required.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing the performance and cost-efficacy of periodic rounds of active case finding (ACF) for TB. METHODS: A mathematical model of TB dynamics and periodic ACF (PACF) in the HIV era, simplified by assuming constant prevalence of latent TB infection, is analyzed for features that control intervention outcome, measured as cases averted and cases found. Explanatory variables include baseline TB incidence, interval between PACF rounds, and different routine and PACF case-detection rates among HIV-infected and uninfected TB cases. FINDINGS: PACF can be cost-saving over a 10 year time frame if the cost-per-round is lower than a threshold proportional to initial incidence and cost-per-case-treated. More cases are averted at higher baseline incidence rates, when more potent PACF strategies are used, intervals between PACF rounds are shorter, and when the ratio of HIV-negative to positive TB cases detected is higher. More costly approaches, e.g. radiographic screening, can be as cost-effective as less costly alternatives if PACF case-detection is higher and/or implementation less frequent. CONCLUSION: Periodic ACF can both improve control and save medium-term health care costs in high TB burden settings. Greater costs of highly effective PACF at frequent (e.g. yearly) intervals may be offset by higher numbers of cases averted in populations with high baseline TB incidence, higher prevalence of HIV-uninfected cases, higher costs per-case-treated, and more effective routine case-detection. Less intensive approaches may still be cost-neutral or cost-saving in populations lacking one or more of these key determinants.},

METHODS: Using a decision analytical model, we compared four diagnostic strategies for TB patients: (i) sputum smear microscopy (SSM) only; (ii) Xpert as a replacement for the rapid diagnostic test currently used for SSM-positive patients at risk of drug resistance (i.e. line probe assay (LPA)); (iii) Upfront Xpert testing for patients at risk of drug resistance; and (iv) Xpert as a replacement for SSM for all patients. RESULTS: The total costs associated with diagnosis for 100,000 presumptive TB cases were: (i) US{\$} 619,042 for SSM-only; (ii) US{\$} 575,377 in the LPA replacement scenario; (iii) US{\$} 720,523 in the SSM replacement scenario; and (iv) US{\$} 1,639,643 in the Xpert-for-all scenario. Total cohort costs, including treatment costs, increased by 46{\%} from the SSM-only to the Xpert-for-all strategy, largely due to the costs associated with second-line treatment of a higher number of rifampicin-resistant patients due to increased drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) case detection. The diagnostic costs for an estimated 7.64 million presumptive TB patients would comprise (i) 19{\%}, (ii) 17{\%}, (iii) 22{\%} and (iv) 50{\%} of the annual TB control budget. Mean total costs, expressed per DR-TB case initiated on treatment, were lowest in the Xpert-for-all scenario (US{\$} 11,099). CONCLUSIONS: The Xpert-for-all strategy would result in the greatest increase of TB and DR-TB case detection, but would also have the highest associated costs. The strategy of using Xpert only for patients at risk for DR-TB would be more affordable, but would miss DR-TB cases and the cost per true DR-TB case detected would be higher compared to the Xpert-for-all strategy. As such expanded Xpert strategy would require significant increased TB control budget to ensure that increased case detection is followed by appropriate care.},

abstract = {SETTING: Although a preventable and treatable disease, tuberculosis (TB) is among the top 10 causes of death worldwide. A consequence of inadequately treated drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) is multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). OBJECTIVES: To improve our understanding of the primary drivers of incidence and prevalence of DS- and MDR-TB in China. METHODS: The Tuberculosis Disease Transmission Model (TBDTM) uses historical and current disease epidemiology and transmission trends and treatment effectiveness, and accounts for annual changes to these to estimate future DS-TB and MDR-TB burden. RESULTS: The model shows that in China, by 2050, incidence, prevalence and mortality of DS-TB will decrease by 32{\%}, 50{\%} and 41{\%}, respectively, whereas MDR-TB will increase by respectively 60{\%}, 48{\%} and 35{\%}. Reduction in DS-TB is a result of high treatment and cure rates leading to a decrease in the prevalence of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI), while the increase in MDR-TB is attributed to inappropriate treatment, leading to high transmission of infection and increased LTBI prevalence. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate a reduction in DS-TB in China over the next 40 years, while MDR-TB will increase. Improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB are needed to counter this threat. The TBDTM tool has potential value in public health practice by demonstrating the impact of interventions and estimating their cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Bovine tuberculosis (BTB) is an endemic zoonosis in Morocco caused by Mycobacterium bovis, which infects many domestic animals and is transmitted to humans through consumption of raw milk or from contact with infected animals. The prevalence of BTB in Moroccan cattle is estimated at 18{\%}, and 33{\%} at the individual and the herd level respectively, but the human M. bovis burden needs further clarification. The current control strategy based on test and slaughter should be improved through local context adaptation taking into account a suitable compensation in order to reduce BTB prevalence in Morocco and decrease the disease burden in humans and animals. We established a simple compartmental deterministic mathematical model for BTB transmission in cattle and humans to provide a general understanding of BTB, in particular regarding transmission to humans. Differential equations were used to model the different pathways between the compartments for cattle and humans. Scenarios of test and slaughter were simulated to determine the effects of varying the proportion of tested animals (p) on the time to elimination of BTB (individual animal prevalence of less than one in a thousand) in cattle and humans. The time to freedom from disease ranged from 75 years for p = 20{\%} to 12 years for p = 100{\%}. For p {\textgreater} 60{\%} the time to elimination was less than 20 years. The cumulated cost was largely stable: for p values higher than 40{\%}, cost ranged from 1.47 to 1.60 billion euros with a time frame of 12 to 32 years to reach freedom from disease. The model simulations also suggest that using a 2mm cut off instead of a 4mm cut off in the Single Intradermal Comparative Cervical Tuberculin skin test (SICCT) would result in cheaper and quicker elimination programs. This analysis informs Moroccan bovine tuberculosis control policy regarding time frame, range of cost and levels of intervention. However, further research is needed to clarify the national human-bovine tuberculosis ratio in Morocco.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), lung cancer, and tuberculosis are three leading causes of death in China, where prevalences of smoking and solid-fuel use are also high. We aimed to predict the effects of risk-factor trends on COPD, lung cancer, and tuberculosis. METHODS: We used representative data sources to estimate past trends in smoking and household solid-fuel use and to construct a range of future scenarios. We obtained the aetiological effects of risk factors on diseases from meta-analyses of epidemiological studies and from large studies in China. We modelled future COPD and lung cancer mortality and tuberculosis incidence, taking into account the accumulation of hazardous effects of risk factors on COPD and lung cancer over time, and dependency of the risk of tuberculosis infection on the prevalence of disease. We quantified the sensitivity of our results to methods and data choices. FINDINGS: If smoking and solid-fuel use remain at current levels between 2003 and 2033, 65 million deaths from COPD and 18 million deaths from lung cancer are predicted in China; 82{\%} of COPD deaths and 75{\%} of lung cancer deaths will be attributable to the combined effects of smoking and solid-fuel use. Complete gradual cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 could avoid 26 million deaths from COPD and 6.3 million deaths from lung cancer; interventions of intermediate magnitude would reduce deaths by 6-31{\%} (COPD) and 8-26{\%} (lung cancer). Complete cessation of smoking and solid-fuel use by 2033 would reduce the projected annual tuberculosis incidence in 2033 by 14-52{\%} if 80{\%} DOTS coverage is sustained, 27-62{\%} if 50{\%} coverage is sustained, or 33-71{\%} if 20{\%} coverage is sustained. INTERPRETATION: Reducing smoking and solid-fuel use can substantially lower predictions of COPD and lung cancer burden and would contribute to effective tuberculosis control in China.},

abstract = {Most models for contaminant dispersion in indoor air are deterministic and do not account for the probabilistic nature of the pollutant concentration at a given room position and time. Such variability can be important when estimating concentrations involving small numbers of contaminant particles. This article describes the use of probabilistic models termed Markov chains to account for a portion of this variability. The deterministic and Markov models are related in that the former provide the expected concentration values. To explain this relationship, a single-zone (well-mixed room) scenario is described as a Markov chain. Subsequently, a two-zone room is cast as a Markov model, and the latter is applied to assessing a health care worker's risk of tuberculosis infection. Airborne particles carrying Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli are usually present in small numbers in a room occupied by an infectious tuberculosis patient. For a given scenario, the Markov model permits estimates of variability in exposure intensity and the resulting variability in infection risk.},

abstract = {Curtailing the public health crises generated by the TB/HIV co-pandemic poses many challenges, including monitoring difficulties that complicate our ability to accurately predict the efficacy of public health interventions. Unfortunately, the dire and urgent need to inform policy makers on the individual and population benefits to be obtained from different disease control measures may result in our prioritizing predicting per se, over conducting in-depth system studies that can maximize our ability to properly address the question(s) posed. In this chapter we illustrate these difficulties and exemplify how analytical studies can be used not only as a powerful predictive tool that can help guide public health policy, but also as a means of gaining important insight into the system's functioning that, in turn, can help the monitoring of pandemics. We present in detail the mathematical, statistical and computational approach and methodology behind our recent research focused on evaluating the potential public health benefits to be derived from reducing TB treatment duration from the standard 6- to 8-month treatments to a 2-month treatment in areas of high HIV prevalence. Because of the considerable uncertainties and spatial and temporal heterogeneity in parameter values we conducted a calibration to historical TB/HIV trends that increased the validity of our predictive results for high HIV prevalence areas. Unexpectedly, our calibration unveiled incongruent epidemiological patterns between the two interacting diseases in Kenya, which led us to evaluate reported TB/HIV co-dynamics for the whole of Africa with a new statistic that quantifies the relative change in TB numbers as compared to HIV numbers. Our initial analysis of pan-African patterns placed Kenya as an outlier. However, Kenyan TB and HIV estimates have since been revised, and now the relative change in the co-dynamics of the two diseases place Kenya in a more intermediate position. We additionally conducted a sensitivity analysis to evaluate which parameters had a greater influence on the output variables of choice. In this chapter we briefly explain the results of our model predictions and of our sensitivity analysis focusing on the general approach and methods because many of the lessons learned related to the reasoning and steps we followed, and not exclusively to the results of our investigation. Thus, here our final conclusions and recommendations are geared towards the analytical process more than the public health implications of our studies. Most importantly, this study taught us the power of contrasting trends of interacting diseases in global disease monitoring and control. This is particularly so for such a complex co-pandemic as TB/HIV, where our analysis of the joint co-dynamics provided important insights into the individual epidemiology of each disease.},

This is the reason why the majority of cases (95{\%}) limits proliferation of the bacilli and produces a long-lasting partial immunity, and 5{\%} of infected individuals develop early progressive disease that occurs within 2-5 years of infection. One of the characteristics of Mycobacterium infection is the replication of the bacteria inside of alveolar macrophages. For this reason 5{\%} of asymptomatic individuals have late disease, which is caused by endogenous reactivation as long as several decades after infection. We develop a simple mathematical model that describes the interaction between Mycobacterium tuberculosis and cellular immune response. The risk of tuberculosis reactivation is determined by granulomas formation on one side and cellular immune response to phagocytize bacteria and to destroy granuloma on other side. The model is analyzed in the initial phase of mycobacterial infection, and an associated risk of tuberculosis among tobacco smokers is established.},

Participants who were tuberculin positive on entry were left unvaccinated; those who were tuberculin negative were allocated at random to an unvaccinated or to a vaccinated group. The protective efficacy of each of the two vaccines, among those initially tuberculin negative, was 84{\%} during the first five years, and gradually decreased, averaging 77{\%} for each vaccine over the whole period. The incidence of tuberculosis decreased substantially in all groups during the trial, however, and of the total of 610 cases of tuberculosis only 27 developed between 15 and 20 years. Thus we cannot make a reliable assessment of efficacy during this final period. The prevalence and incidence of tuberculosis in Great Britain have decreased radically since this trial began. The expected benefit from large-scale BCG-vaccination of children is now far less, and may decrease further if the incidence of tuberculosis continues to decline.},

abstract = {Objective: Assess the current BCG vaccination policies and delivery pathways for immunisation in Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England since the 2005 change in recommendations. Design: A survey of key informants across PCTs using a standardised, structured questionnaire. Setting: 152 PCTs in England. Results: Complete questionnaires were returned from 127 (84{\%}) PCTs. Sixteen (27{\%}) PCTs reported universal infant vaccination and 111 (73{\%}) had selective infant vaccination. Selective vaccination outside infancy was also reported from 94 (74{\%}) PCTs. PCTs with selective infant policy most frequently vaccinated on postnatal wards (51/102, 50{\%}), whereas PCTs with universal infant vaccination most frequently vaccinated in community clinics (9/13, 69{\%}; p=0.011). To identify and flag up eligible infants in PCTs with targeted infant immunisation, those who mostly vaccinate on postnatal wards depend on midwives and maternity records, whereas those who vaccinate primarily in the community rely more often on various healthcare professionals. Conclusions: Targeted infant vaccination has been implemented in most PCTs across the UK. PCTs with selective infant vaccination provide BCG vaccine via a greater variety of healthcare professionals than those with universal infant vaccination policies. Data on vaccine coverage would help evaluate the effectiveness of delivery. Interruptions of delivery noted here emphasise the importance of not just an agreed, standardised, local pathway, but also a named person in charge.},

abstract = {In the United Kingdom, BCG immunization of neonates provides good protection against military and meningeal disease, and probably against other forms of tuberculosis, in all ethnic groups. Serious adverse reactions to BCG immunization are rare. Cost-effectiveness studies of BCG immunization in neonates have not been reported, and 'universal' BCG immunization is not recommended in the United Kingdom. The Department of Health does recommend immunization for children and infants of immigrants from countries with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. There are problems associated with such a 'selective' policy, as determining what is 'high' prevalence and thus defining 'at risk' groups is difficult, and there may be political and practical difficulties in its implementation. This may result in low coverage in eligible groups. A 'universal' policy of BCG immunization for all neonates may be politically more acceptable and easier to implement in districts with high tuberculosis notification rates. Although there is no cost-effectiveness data to determine at what tuberculosis notification rate a universal policy should be adopted, an universal policy has been suggested for districts with overall notification rate of greater than 40 per 100,000. Within districts there may be large variations in tuberculosis notification rates between different areas. This is becoming more common with the amalgamation and merger of smaller districts into new larger purchasing organizations. New River Health Authority is such a district formed by the amalgamation of the former districts of Haringey with a high tuberculosis notification rate, and Enfield with a lower TB notification rate. In order to maximize coverage in the 'at risk' neonates, a different neonatal BCG policy has been adopted in the two areas. This has been possible because of the flexibility of the mechanisms for contracting with different provider units. Although the overall notification rate was not thought to be sufficiently high to justify a 'universal' neonatal policy throughout the district, a 'universal' policy has been instituted in the main provider unit in the former district Haringey. A 'selective' policy, subject to ongoing evaluation to ensure high coverage, continues to be operated by the main provider unit in the former district of Enfield.},

abstract = {Little information exists on the pulmonary pharmacology of antituberculosis drugs. We used population pharmacokinetic modeling and Monte Carlo simulation to describe and explore the pulmonary pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of rifampin (RIF; rifampicin). A population pharmacokinetic model that adequately described the plasma, epithelial lining fluid (ELF), and alveolar cell (AC) concentrations of RIF in a population of 34 human volunteers was made by use of the nonparametric adaptive grid (NPAG) algorithm. The estimated concentrations correlated well with the measured concentrations, and there was little bias and good precision. The results obtained with the NPAG algorithm were then imported into Matlab software to perform a 10,000-subject Monte Carlo simulation. The ability of RIF to suppress the development of drug resistance and to induce a sufficient bactericidal effect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis was evaluated by calculating the proportion of subjects achieving specific target values for the maximum concentration of drug (C(max))/MIC ratio and the area under the concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 h (AUC(0-24))/MIC ratio, respectively. At the lowest MIC (0.01 mg/liter), after the administration of one 600-mg oral dose, the rates of target attainment for C(max)/MIC ({\textgreater} or =175) were 95{\%} in ACs, 48.8{\%} in plasma, and 35.9{\%} in ELF. Under the same conditions, the target attainment results for the killing effect were 100{\%} in plasma (AUC(0-24)/MIC {\textgreater} or = 271) but only 54.5{\%} in ELF (AUC(0-24)/MIC {\textgreater} or = 665). The use of a 1,200-mg RIF dose was associated with better results for target attainment. The overall results suggest that the pulmonary concentrations obtained with the standard RIF dose are too low in most subjects. This work supports the need to evaluate higher doses of RIF for the treatment of patients with tuberculosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73{\%}. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective. However, the low number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated severe TB cases leads to broad confidence intervals on vaccine efficacy, highlighting the difficulty associated with decision-making in low-prevalence settings.},

The extreme occurs when a switching function disappears suddenly over an open interval.

The second-order of the function is not vanishing, which satisfied Legendre-Clebsh condition, and thus the controls of these kinds are called singular.

abstract = {SETTING: A combination of environmental measurement and mathematical modelling may provide a more quantitative method to inform the tuberculosis (TB) screening process in non-household settings following diagnosis of an infectious case. OBJECTIVE: To explore different methods for environmental assessment and mathematical modelling to predict TB transmission risk and devise a tool for public health practitioners for use in TB investigations. DESIGN: Parameters including air flow, carbon dioxide (CO(2)) and airborne particles were measured over 3 working days in an office with a staff member with infectious TB. The Wells-Riley model was applied to predict transmission rates. RESULTS: The results suggested that poor ventilation and well-mixed air led to equal exposure of staff members to airborne TB bacilli. The model's prediction of attack rate (42{\%}) supported the actual number of infections that occurred (50{\%}). CONCLUSION: This study supports the use of environmental assessment and modelling as a tool for public health practitioners to determine the extent of TB exposure and to inform TB screening strategies. CO(2) and airborne particle profiles, both measured via a handheld device, provide the greatest practicality and amount of information that public health practitioners can use. Further studies will validate the level of screening required related to these measurements.},

abstract = {South Africa has one of the highest burdens of TB worldwide, driven by the country's widespread prevalence of HIV, and further complicated by drug resistance. Active case finding within the community, particularly in rural areas where healthcare access is limited, can significantly improve diagnosis and treatment coverage in high-incidence settings. We evaluated the potential health and economic consequences of implementing community-based TB/HIV screening and linkage to care. Using a dynamic model of TB and HIV transmission over a time horizon of 10 years, we compared status quo TB/HIV control to community-based TB/HIV screening at frequencies of once every two years, one year, and six months. We also considered the impact of extending IPT from 36 months for TST positive and 12 months for TST negative or unknown patients (36/12) to lifetime use for all HIV-infected patients. We conducted a probabilistic sensitivity analysis to assess the effect of parameter uncertainty on the cost-effectiveness results. We identified four strategies that saved the most life years for a given outlay: status quo TB/HIV control with 36/12 months of IPT and TB/HIV screening strategies at frequencies of once every two years, one year, and six months with lifetime IPT. All of these strategies were very cost-effective at a threshold of {\$}6,618 per life year saved (the per capita GDP of South Africa). Community-based TB/HIV screening with linkage to care is therefore very cost-effective in rural South Africa.},

In a previously unreported development, binary integer programming can be extended to consider shared fixed costs, a widespread problem in optimizing effectiveness measures such as health status. The model proposed here applies conceptually across all target populations and health programs and could be used to optimize the output of a total health system. The effects of such optimization would be appropriately reflected in the weighted life expectancy computed as a social indicator.},

abstract = {A mathematical model is presented of the growth and death of bacilli in a granuloma. The granuloma is treated with isoniazid (INH), a drug that inhibits the synthesis of mycolic acids (MA). Since MA is an essential component of cell walls, the organisms fail to reach maturity if deficient in MA. Cell wall turnover is a well-known feature of bacteria, at the exterior surface material sloughs off to foil attacks by hosts or other organisms, simultaneously synthesizing products for new cell wall assembly. Thus cell wall thickness is maintained in a dynamic equilibrium (Doyle et al., 1988). Presumably cell death is a result of loss in cell wall due to autolysis in combination with stinted replenishing. The mathematical model presented here uses differential equations to predict the effects of intracellular INH on cell wall thickness and cell viability. This analysis purposely distinguishes intracellular INH concentration from the concentration in the plasma. The concentration in the plasma depends only on the dosing. The intracellular INH concentration, however, depends on diffusion through the cell walls of the bacteria. This paper addresses the complex interactions between intracellular INH, cell wall thickness, and the rate of cell wall synthesis.},

abstract = {The effective action for type II string theory compactified on a six torus is {\$}N=8{\$} supergravity, which is known to have an {\$}E{\_}{\{}7{\}}{\$} duality symmetry. We show that this is broken by quantum effects to a discrete subgroup, {\$}E{\_}7(\backslashZ){\$}, which contains both the T-duality group {\$}SO(6,6;\backslashZ){\$} and the S-duality group {\$}SL(2;\backslashZ){\$}. We present evidence for the conjecture that {\$}E{\_}7(\backslashZ){\$} is an exact $\backslash$lq U-duality' symmetry of type II string theory. This conjecture requires certain extreme black hole states to be identified with massive modes of the fundamental string. The gauge bosons from the Ramond-Ramond sector couple not to string excitations but to solitons. We discuss similar issues in the context of toroidal string compactifications to other dimensions, compactifications of the type II string on {\$}K{\_}3\backslashtimes T{\^{}}2{\$} and compactifications of eleven-dimensional supermembrane theory.},

However, as there are few quantitative methods for evaluating their joint effects, resolving this interaction is difficult. We develop a method that aims to evaluate the interaction between phylogenetic structure, historical biogeographic events and environmental filtering in driving species distributions in a large-scale metacommunity. Using freshwater zooplankton as a case study, we contrast the phylogenetic metacommunity structure of calanoid copepods and an ecologically similar but more vagile group, daphniids, in the northeastern US. We find that legacies of historical biogeographical events have strongly constrained calanoid distributions within this area, but that adaptation to different water chemistry and lake morphology drives the metacommunity structure of daphniids. Our findings show that biogeographic history and metacommunity processes jointly regulate community structure in these lakes and suggest that this also depends on factors that affect the colonization rate of different types of organisms.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB) is a major health challenge in India that is gaining increasing public attention, but the implications of India's evolving MDR TB epidemic are poorly understood. As India's MDR TB epidemic is transitioning from a treatment-generated to transmission-generated epidemic, we sought to evaluate the potential effectiveness of the following two disease control strategies on reducing the prevalence of MDR TB: a) improving treatment of non-MDR TB; b) shortening the infectious period between the activation of MDR TB and initiation of effective MDR treatment. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic transmission microsimulation model of TB in India. The model followed individuals by age, sex, TB status, drug resistance status, and treatment status and was calibrated to Indian demographic and epidemiologic TB time trends. The main effectiveness measure was reduction in the average prevalence reduction of MDR TB over the ten years after control strategy implementation. We find that improving non-MDR cure rates to avoid generating new MDR cases will provide substantial non-MDR TB benefits but will become less effective in reducing MDR TB prevalence over time because more cases will occur from direct transmission--by 2015, the model estimates 42{\%} of new MDR cases are transmission-generated and this proportion continues to rise over time, assuming equal transmissibility of MDR and drug-susceptible TB. Strategies that disrupt MDR transmission by shortening the time between MDR activation and treatment are projected to provide greater reductions in MDR prevalence compared with improving non-MDR treatment quality: implementing MDR diagnostic improvements in 2017 is expected to reduce MDR prevalence by 39{\%}, compared with 11{\%} reduction from improving non-MDR treatment quality. CONCLUSIONS: As transmission-generated MDR TB becomes a larger driver of the MDR TB epidemic in India, rapid and accurate MDR TB diagnosis and treatment will become increasingly effective in reducing MDR TB cases compared to non-MDR TB treatment improvements.},

abstract = {Variable numbers of tandem repeats (VNTR) typing is widely used for studying the bacterial cause of tuberculosis. Knowledge of the rate of mutation of VNTR loci facilitates the study of the evolution and epidemiology of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Previous studies have applied population genetic models to estimate the mutation rate, leading to estimates varying widely from around [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text] per locus per year. Resolving this issue using more detailed models and statistical methods would lead to improved inference in the molecular epidemiology of tuberculosis. Here, we use a model-based approach that incorporates two alternative forms of a stepwise mutation process for VNTR evolution within an epidemiological model of disease transmission. Using this model in a Bayesian framework we estimate the mutation rate of VNTR in M. tuberculosis from four published data sets of VNTR profiles from Albania, Iran, Morocco and Venezuela. In the first variant, the mutation rate increases linearly with respect to repeat numbers (linear model); in the second, the mutation rate is constant across repeat numbers (constant model). We find that under the constant model, the mean mutation rate per locus is [Formula: see text] (95{\%} CI: [Formula: see text],[Formula: see text])and under the linear model, the mean mutation rate per locus per repeat unit is [Formula: see text] (95{\%} CI: [Formula: see text],[Formula: see text]). These new estimates represent a high rate of mutation at VNTR loci compared to previous estimates. To compare the two models we use posterior predictive checks to ascertain which of the two models is better able to reproduce the observed data. From this procedure we find that the linear model performs better than the constant model. The general framework we use allows the possibility of extending the analysis to more complex models in the future.},

abstract = {Contact tracing (also known as partner notification) is a primary means of controlling infectious diseases such as tuberculosis (TB), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and sexually transmitted diseases (STDs). However, little work has been done to determine the optimal level of investment in contact tracing. In this paper, we present a methodology for evaluating the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing. We develop and apply a simulation model of contact tracing and the spread of an infectious disease among a network of individuals in order to evaluate the cost and effectiveness of different levels of contact tracing. We show that contact tracing is likely to have diminishing returns to scale in investment: incremental investments in contact tracing yield diminishing reductions in disease prevalence. In conjunction with a cost-effectiveness threshold, we then determine the optimal amount that should be invested in contact tracing. We first assume that the only incremental disease control is contact tracing. We then extend the analysis to consider the optimal allocation of a budget between contact tracing and screening for exogenous infection, and between contact tracing and screening for endogenous infection. We discuss how a simulation model of this type, appropriately tailored, could be used as a policy tool for determining the appropriate level of investment in contact tracing for a specific disease in a specific population. We present an example application to contact tracing for chlamydia control.},

abstract = {The objective of this article is to characterize the risk of infection from airborne Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli exposure in commercial passenger trains based on a risk-based probabilistic transmission modeling. We investigated the tuberculosis (TB) infection risks among commercial passengers by inhaled aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli and quantify the patterns of TB transmission in Taiwan High Speed Rail (THSR). A deterministic Wells-Riley mathematical model was used to account for the probability of infection risk from M. tuberculosis bacilli by linking the cough-generated aerosol M. tuberculosis bacilli concentration and particle size distribution. We found that (i) the quantum generation rate of TB was estimated with a lognormal distribution of geometric mean (GM) of 54.29 and geometric standard deviation (GSD) of 3.05 quantum/h at particle size {\textless}/= 5 mum and (ii) the basic reproduction numbers (R(0) ) were estimated to be 0.69 (0.06-6.79), 2.82 (0.32-20.97), and 2.31 (0.25-17.69) for business, standard, and nonreserved cabins, respectively. The results indicate that commercial passengers taking standard and nonreserved cabins had higher transmission risk than those in business cabins based on conservatism. Our results also reveal that even a brief exposure, as in the bronchoscopy cases, can also result in a transmission when the quantum generation rate is high. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the dynamics of TB transmission in commercial passenger trains by assessing the relationship between TB infectiousness, passenger mobility, and key model parameters such as seat occupancy, ventilation rate, and exposure duration.},

These funds are allocated at multiple levels, resulting in a highly complicated distribution process. An oversight agency allocates funds to various national-level decision-makers who then allocate funds to regional-level decision-makers who in turn distribute the monies to local organizations, programs, or risk groups. Simple allocation techniques are often preferred by the decision-makers at each administrative level, but such methods can lead to sub-optimal allocation of funds. Thus, incentives could be provided to decisionmakers in order to encourage optimal allocation of HIV/AIDS prevention resources. We formulate an incentive-based resource allocation model that takes into consideration strategic interactions between decision-makers in a multiple-level resource-allocation process. We analyze each decision-maker's behavior at the equilibrium and summarize the results that characterize the optimal solution to the resource-allocation problem. Our intended audiences are technical experts, decision-makers, and policy-makers in governments who can make use of incentives to encourage effective decisions regarding HIV/AIDS policy modeling and budget allocation at local levels.},

abstract = {Infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a major world health problem. An estimated 2 billion people are presently infected and the disease causes approximately 3 million deaths per year. After bacteria are inhaled into the lung, a complex immune response is triggered leading to the formation of multicellular structures termed granulomas. It is believed that the collection of host granulomas either contain bacteria resulting in a latent infection or are unable to do so, leading to active disease. Thus, understanding granuloma formation and function is essential for improving both diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis. Granuloma formation is a complex spatio-temporal system involving interactions of bacteria, specific immune cells, including macrophages, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, as well as immune effectors such as chemokine and cytokines. To study this complex dynamical system we have developed an agent-based model of granuloma formation in the lung. This model combines continuous representations of chemokines with discrete agent representations of macrophages and T cells in a cellular automata-like environment. Our results indicate that key host elements involved in granuloma formation are chemokine diffusion, prevention of macrophage overcrowding within the granuloma, arrival time, location and number of T cells within the granuloma, and an overall host ability to activate macrophages. Interestingly, a key bacterial factor is its intracellular growth rate, whereby slow growth actually facilitates survival.},

abstract = {Background: In settings with high tuberculosis (TB) prevalence, 15–30{\%} of HIV-infected individuals initiating antiretroviral therapy (ART) have undiagnosed TB. Such patients are usually screened by symptoms and sputum smear, which have poor sensitivity. Objective: To project the clinical and economic outcomes of using Xpert MTB/RIF(Xpert), a rapid TB/rifampicin-resistance diagnostic, to screen individuals initiating ART. Design: We used a microsimulation model to evaluate the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative TB screening modalities – in all patients or only symptomatic patients – for hypothetical cohorts of individuals initiating ART in South Africa (mean CD4 cell count = 171 cells/$\mu$l; TB prevalence 22{\%}). We simulated no active screening and four diagnostic strategies, smear microscopy (sensitivity 23{\%}); smear and culture (sensitivity, 100{\%}); one Xpert sample (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 43{\%}); two Xpert samples (sensitivity in smear-negative TB: 62{\%}). Outcomes included projected life expectancy, lifetime costs (2010 US{\$}), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Strategies with ICERs less than {\$}7100 (South African gross domestic product per capita) were considered very cost-effective. Results: Compared with no screening, life expectancy in TB-infected patients increased by 1.6 months using smear in symptomatic patients and by 6.6 months with two Xpert samples in all patients. At 22{\%} TB prevalence, the ICER of smear for all patients was {\$}2800 per year of life saved (YLS), and of Xpert (two samples) for all patients was {\$}5100/YLS. Strategies involving one Xpert sample or symptom screening were less efficient. Conclusion: Model-based analysis suggests that screening all individuals initiating ART in South Africa with two Xpert samples is very cost-effective.},

Even in areas where tuberculosis is in decline, there are sporadic outbreaks which are often attributed either to increased host susceptibility or increased strain transmissibility and virulence. Using two mathematical models, we explore the role of the contact structure of the population, and find that in declining epidemics, localized outbreaks may occur as a result of contact heterogeneity even in the absence of host or strain variability. We discuss the implications of this finding for tuberculosis control in low incidence settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In July 2008 a case of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a white UK-born nursery teacher was notified in London. The case had been symptomatic for 9 months while working in the nursery. The outbreak is described and the protective effect of BCG vaccination against latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as measured by an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is assessed. METHODS: Screening by chest X-ray and IGRA of nursery children, staff and their contacts was conducted using a 'stone-in-the pond' approach. Information was collected on various factors including BCG vaccination status, and data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 168 children, 31 staff members and 57 other adults associated with the nursery were screened for TB. There were 12 cases of active TB and 43 cases of latent TB (72{\%} children). 37.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 18{\%} to 56{\%}) and 40{\%} (95{\%} CI 30{\%} to 50{\%}) had a positive IGRA among teachers and children, respectively. 42{\%} of children and 60{\%} of adults were BCG vaccinated. In the adjusted analysis, BCG vaccination showed a significant protective effect against M tuberculosis infection in children (OR 0.25, 95{\%} CI 0.09 to 0.69) and being taught by the index case was associated with acquiring TB infection (OR 18.91, 95{\%} CI 4.43 to 80.79). A vaccine effectiveness of 66{\%} was calculated, implying that 21 of the 32 infections could have been avoided if all children had been vaccinated with BCG. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak shows extensive transmission of TB among very young children. BCG seems to have a protective effect against TB infection as assessed by positive IGRA in this cohort.},

@article{Pretorius2014,
abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Reliable estimates of the joint burden of HIV and tuberculosis epidemics are crucial to planning strategic global and national tuberculosis responses. Prior to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2013, the Global Tuberculosis Programme (GTB) released estimates for tuberculosis-HIV incidence at the global level only. Neither GTB nor United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) published country specific estimates for tuberculosis-HIV mortality. We used a regression approach that combined all available data from GTB and UNAIDS in order to estimate tuberculosis-HIV incidence and mortality at country level. METHODS: A regression method was devised to relate CD4 dynamics (based on national Spectrum files) to an increased relative risk (RR) of tuberculosis disease. The objective function is based on least squares and incorporates all available country-level estimates of tuberculosis-HIV incidence. Global regression parameters, obtained from averaging results over countries with population survey estimates for tuberculosis-HIV burden, were applied to countries with no survey tuberculosis-HIV incidence estimates. RESULTS: The method produced results that are in reasonably close agreement with existing GTB estimates for global tuberculosis-HIV burden. It estimated that tuberculosis-HIV accounts for 12.6{\%} of global tuberculosis incidence, 21.3{\%} of all tuberculosis deaths, and 20{\%} of all HIV deaths as estimated by the Spectrum AIDS Impact Module (AIM). Regional estimates show the highest absolute incidence burden in East and Southeast Asia, and the highest per capita burden in sub-Saharan Africa, where between 12.5{\%} (Central sub-Saharan Africa) and 60.6{\%} (Southern sub-Saharan Africa) of all tuberculosis disease occurs in people living with HIV (PLWH). Tuberculosis mortality follows a similar pattern, except that a disproportionate percentage of global tuberculosis deaths (12.1{\%}) relative to global incidence (8.7{\%}) occurred in Southern sub-Saharan Africa. CONCLUSION: The disaggregation of tuberculosis incidence using a regression method on RR of tuberculosis disease and all available data on HIV burden (from UNAIDS) and tuberculosis-HIV testing (survey, sentinel and routine surveillance data) produces results that closely match GTB estimates for 2011. The tuberculosis-HIV incidence and mortality results were published in the Global Tuberculosis Report 2013. Several limitations of and potential improvements to the process are suggested.},

abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}The science of networks has revolutionised research into the dynamics of interacting elements. It could be argued that epidemiology in particular has embraced the potential of network theory more than any other discipline. Here we review the growing body of research concerning the spread of infectious diseases on networks, focusing on the interplay between network theory and epidemiology. The review is split into four main sections, which examine: the types of network relevant to epidemiology; the multitude of ways these networks can be characterised; the statistical methods that can be applied to infer the epidemiological parameters on a realised network; and finally simulation and analytical methods to determine epidemic dynamics on a given network. Given the breadth of areas covered and the ever-expanding number of publications, a comprehensive review of all work is impossible. Instead, we provide a personalised overview into the areas of network epidemiology that have seen the greatest progress in recent years or have the greatest potential to provide novel insights. As such, considerable importance is placed on analytical approaches and statistical methods which are both rapidly expanding fields. Throughout this review we restrict our attention to epidemiological issues.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yet 90-95{\%} of those who are infected with MTB remain otherwise healthy. These people are classified as "latently infected," but remain a reservoir from which active TB cases will continue to develop ("reactivation tuberculosis"). Latent infection is defined by the absence of clinical symptoms of TB in addition to a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to the purified protein derivative of MTB used in tuberculin skin test or a T-cell response to MTB-specific antigens. In the absence of reliable control measures for tuberculosis, understanding latent MTB infection and subsequent reactivation is a research priority. This review aims to summarize the recent findings in human and non-human primate models of tuberculosis that have led to new concepts of latent tuberculosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Randomized trials assessing BCG vaccine protection against tuberculosis have widely varying results, for reasons that are not well understood. METHODS: We examined associations of trial setting and design with BCG efficacy against pulmonary and miliary or meningeal tuberculosis by conducting a systematic review, meta-analyses, and meta-regression. RESULTS: We identified 18 trials reporting pulmonary tuberculosis and 6 reporting miliary or meningeal tuberculosis. Univariable meta-regression indicated efficacy against pulmonary tuberculosis varied according to 3 characteristics. Protection appeared greatest in children stringently tuberculin tested, to try to exclude prior infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis or sensitization to environmental mycobacteria (rate ratio [RR], 0.26; 95{\%} confidence interval [CI], .18-.37), or infants (RR, 0.41; 95{\%} CI, .29-.58). Protection was weaker in children not stringently tested (RR, 0.59; 95{\%} CI, .35-1.01) and older individuals stringently or not stringently tested (RR, 0.88; 95{\%} CI, .59-1.31 and RR, 0.81; 95{\%} CI, .55-1.22, respectively). Protection was higher in trials further from the equator where environmental mycobacteria are less and with lower risk of diagnostic detection bias. These associations were attenuated in a multivariable model, but each had an independent effect. There was no evidence that efficacy was associated with BCG strain. Protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis was also high in infants (RR, 0.1; 95{\%} CI, .01-.77) and children stringently tuberculin tested (RR, 0.08; 95{\%} CI, .03-.25). CONCLUSIONS: Absence of prior M. tuberculosis infection or sensitization with environmental mycobacteria is associated with higher efficacy of BCG against pulmonary tuberculosis and possibly against miliary and meningeal tuberculosis. Evaluations of new tuberculosis vaccines should account for the possibility that prior infection may mask or block their effects.},

abstract = {Despite extensive studies on the interactions between Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) and macrophages, the mechanism by which pathogen evades anti-microbial responses and establishes persistence within the host cell remains unknown. In this study, we developed a four-dimensional ODE model to describe the dynamics of host-pathogen interactions in the early phase of macrophage infection. The aim was to characterize the role of host cellular regulators such as iron and lipids, in addition to the bactericidal effector molecule Nitric Oxide. Conditions for existence and stability of the equilibrium point were analysed by examining the behaviour of the model through numerical simulations. These computational investigations revealed that it was the ability of pathogen to interfere with iron and lipid homeostatic pathways of the host cell, which ensured a shift in balance towards pathogen survival and persistence. Interestingly, small perturbations in this equilibrium triggered the cell's bactericidal response, thereby producing an oscillatory dynamic for disease progression.},

Our model is consider with bilinear incidence and migration between two patches, where infected and infectious individuals cannot migrate from one patch to another, due to medical reasons. The existence and uniqueness of the associated endemic equilibria are discussed. Quadratic forms and Lyapunov functions are used to show that when the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium (DFE) is globally asymptotically stable, and when it is greater than one there exists in each case a unique endemic equilibrium (boundary equilibria and endemic equilibrium) which is globally asymptotically stable.

This control strategy indicates how the control of the class of lost of sight can considerably influence the basic reproduction ratio so as to reduce their number.

Our main interest is to assess the impact of the competition among bacteria on the infection prevalence. For this end, we assume that Mtb population has two types of growth. The first one is due to bacteria produced in the interior of each infected macrophage, and it is assumed that is proportional to the number of infected macrophages. The second one is of logistic type due to the competition among free bacteria released by the same infected macrophages. The qualitative analysis and numerical results suggests the existence of forward, backward and S-shaped bifurcations when the associated reproduction number R-0 of the Mtb is less unity. In addition, qualitative analysis of the model shows that there may be up to three bacteria-present equilibria, two locally asymptotically stable, and one unstable.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE To identify and characterise non-specific immunological effects after routine childhood vaccines against BCG, measles, diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus. DESIGN Systematic review of randomised controlled trials, cohort studies, and case-control studies. DATA SOURCES Embase, PubMed, Cochrane library, and Trip searched between 1947 and January 2014. Publications submitted by a panel of experts in the specialty were also included. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING STUDIES All human studies reporting non-specific immunological effects after vaccination with standard childhood immunisations. Studies using recombinant vaccines, no vaccine at all, or reporting only vaccine specific outcomes were excluded. The primary aim was to systematically identify, assemble, and review all available studies and data on the possible non-specific or heterologous immunological effects of BCG; measles; mumps, measles, and rubella (MMR); diphtheria; tetanus; and pertussis vaccines. RESULTS The initial search yielded 11 168 references; 77 manuscripts met the inclusion criteria for data analysis. In most included studies (48{\%}) BCG was the vaccine intervention. The final time point of outcome measurement was primarily performed (70{\%}) between one and 12 months after vaccination. There was a high risk of bias in the included studies, with no single study rated low risk across all assessment criteria. A total of 143 different immunological variables were reported, which, in conjunction with differences in measurement units and summary statistics, created a high number of combinations thus precluding any meta-analysis. Studies that compared BCG vaccinated with unvaccinated groups showed a trend towards increased IFN-$\gamma$ production in vitro in the vaccinated groups. Increases were also observed for IFN-$\gamma$ measured after BCG vaccination in response to in vitro stimulation with microbial antigens from Candida albicans, tetanus toxoid, Staphylococcus aureas, lipopolysaccharide, and hepatitis B. Cohort studies of measles vaccination showed an increase in lymphoproliferation to microbial antigens from tetanus toxoid and C albicans Increases in immunogenicity to heterologous antigens were noted after diphtheria-tetanus (herpes simplex virus and polio antibody titres) and diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (pneumococcus serotype 14 and polio neutralising responses) vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The papers reporting non-specific immunological effects had heterogeneous study designs and could not be conventionally meta-analysed, providing a low level of evidence quality. Some studies, such as BCG vaccine studies examining in vitro IFN-$\gamma$ responses and measles vaccine studies examining lymphoproliferation to microbial antigen stimulation, showed a consistent direction of effect suggestive of non-specific immunological effects. The quality of the evidence, however, does not provide confidence in the nature, magnitude, or timing of non-specific immunological effects after vaccination with BCG, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, or measles containing vaccines nor the clinical importance of the findings.},

In this work, optimal control theory is used to propose optimal TB prevention and control strategy and rearrange the government TB budget for the best TB elimination plan. The impact of distancing, case finding, and/or case holding controls are investigated when the number of infected and infectious individuals are minimized, while the intervention costs are kept low. The implementation of optimal control measures shows that the distancing control, such as isolation of infectious people, early TB patient detection, and educational program/campaign for healthy control, is the most effective control factor for the prevention of TB transmission in South Korea.},

BCG's limited efficacy coupled with the emergence of drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis emphasizes the need for a more effective vaccine for combatting this disease. However, the development of a TB vaccine is hindered by the lack of immune correlates, suboptimal animal models, and limited funding. An adolescent/adult vaccine would have the greatest public health impact, but effective delivery of such a vaccine will require a better understanding of global TB epidemiology, improved infrastructure, and engagement of public health leaders and global manufacturers. Here we discuss the current state of tuberculosis vaccine research and development, including our understanding of the underlying immunology as well as the challenges and opportunities that may hinder or facilitate the development of a new and efficacious vaccine.},

In this paper, we describe and discuss mathematical models that can be used to explore the potential of pre-exposure and post-exposure vaccines currently under development in the control of tuberculosis. A model with bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination for the susceptibles and treatment for the infectives is first presented. The epidemic thresholds known as the basic reproduction numbers and equilibria for the models are determined and stabilities are investigated. The reproduction numbers for the models are compared to assess the impact of the vaccines currently under development. The centre manifold theory is used to show the existence of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number is less than unity and that the unique endemic equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable when the associated reproduction number is greater than unity. From the study we conclude that the pre-exposure vaccine currently under development coupled with chemoprophylaxis for the latently infected and treatment of infectives is more effective when compared to the post-exposure vaccine currently under development for the latently infected coupled with treatment of the infectives. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

We analyzed the transmission dynamics of XDR TB in the region using mathematical models, and observed that nosocomial transmission clusters of XDR TB may emerge into community-based epidemics under the public health conditions of many South African communities. The effective reproductive number of XDR TB in KwaZulu-Natal may be around 2. Intensified community-based case finding and therapy appears critical to curtailing transmission. In the setting of delayed disease presentation and high system demand, improved diagnostic approaches may need to be employed in community-based programs rather than exclusively at tertiary hospitals. Using branching process mathematics, we observed that early, community-based drug-susceptibility testing and effective XDR therapy could help curtail ongoing transmission and reduce the probability of XDR TB epidemics in neighboring territories.},

abstract = {A key issue in the dynamical modelling of epidemics is the synthesis of complex mathematical models and data by means of time series analysis. We report such an approach, focusing on the particularly well-documented case of measles. We propose the use of a discrete time epidemic model comprising the infected and susceptible class as state variables. The model uses a discrete time version of the susceptible-exposed-infected-recovered type epidemic models, which can be fitted to observed disease incidence time series. We describe a method for reconstructing the dynamics of the susceptible class, which is an unobserved state variable of the dynamical system. The model provides a remarkable fit to the data on case reports of measles in England and Wales from 1944 to 1964. Morever, its systematic part explains the well-documented predominant biennial cyclic pattern. We study the dynamic behaviour of the time series model and show that episodes of annual cyclicity, which have not previously been explained quantitatively, arise as a response to a quicker replenishment of the susceptible class during the baby boom, around 1947.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: The search for small molecules with activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) increasingly uses high throughput screening and computational methods. Several public datasets from the Collaborative Drug Discovery Tuberculosis (CDD TB) database have been evaluated with cheminformatics approaches to validate their utility and suggest compounds for testing. METHODS: Previously reported Bayesian classification models were used to predict a set of 283 Novartis compounds tested against Mtb (containing aerobic and anaerobic hits) and to search FDA approved drugs. The Novartis compounds were also filtered with computational SMARTS alerts to identify potentially undesirable substructures. RESULTS: Using the Novartis compounds as a test set for the Bayesian models demonstrated a {\textgreater}4.0-fold enrichment over random screening for finding aerobic hits not in the computational models (N = 34). A 10-fold enrichment was observed for finding Mtb active compounds in the FDA drugs database. 85.9{\%} of the Novartis compounds failed the Abbott SMARTS alerts, a value substantially higher than for known TB drugs. Higher levels of failures of SMARTS filters from different groups also correlate with the number of Lipinski violations. CONCLUSIONS: These computational approaches may assist in finding desirable leads for Tuberculosis drug discovery.},

abstract = {Interleukin-10 (IL-10) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) are key anti- and pro-inflammatory mediators elicited during the host immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Understanding the opposing effects of these mediators is difficult due to the complexity of processes acting across different spatial (molecular, cellular, and tissue) and temporal (seconds to years) scales. We take an in silico approach and use multi-scale agent based modeling of the immune response to Mtb, including molecular scale details for both TNF-alpha and IL-10. Our model predicts that IL-10 is necessary to modulate macrophage activation levels and to prevent host-induced tissue damage in a granuloma, an aggregate of cells that forms in response to Mtb. We show that TNF-alpha and IL-10 parameters related to synthesis, signaling, and spatial distribution processes control concentrations of TNF-alpha and IL-10 in a granuloma and determine infection outcome in the long-term. We devise an overall measure of granuloma function based on three metrics - total bacterial load, macrophage activation levels, and apoptosis of resting macrophages - and use this metric to demonstrate a balance of TNF-alpha and IL-10 concentrations is essential to Mtb infection control, within a single granuloma, with minimal host-induced tissue damage. Our findings suggest that a balance of TNF-alpha and IL-10 defines a granuloma environment that may be beneficial for both host and pathogen, but perturbing the balance could be used as a novel therapeutic strategy to modulate infection outcomes.},

abstract = {The protective effect of BCG against tuberculosis (TB) estimated in randomized controlled trials and observational studies ranges from negative to close to a 100{\%}. One of the many explanations offered for this is that different immunological mechanisms may be associated with protective effect against different forms and sites of disease. In this investigation, we recalculated vaccine protective effect separately for pulmonary disease and for meningeal/miliary disease in randomized controlled trials and case-control studies, tested for heterogeneity in site-specific estimates of protective effect and calculated a summary measure when appropriate. We found protective effect against pulmonary disease to be heterogeneous to a statistically significant degree, and thus we did not calculate a summary measure of protection. Protective effect against meningeal and miliary TB was higher than against pulmonary disease and, except for a single study with two cases only, appeared to be homogenous. Summary BCG protective effect against miliary or meningeal TB in randomized controlled trials was 86{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI] 65, 95) and in case-control studies 75{\%} (95{\%} CI: 61, 84). The fact that protective effect appeared to be homogeneous against meningitis and miliary TB but not against pulmonary disease may result from the fact that patients with meningitis are on average younger and thus less likely to have been exposed to atypical bacteria; to a waning of the protective effect of BCG; or from the diversity of mechanisms of pathogenesis of pulmonary disease, which can originate from reinfection, reactivation or primary progression.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Almost 20{\%} of people smoke tobacco worldwide--a percentage projected to rise in many poor countries. Smoking has been linked to increased individual risk of tuberculosis infection and mortality, but it remains unclear how these risks affect population-wide tuberculosis rates. DESIGN: We constructed a state transition, compartmental, mathematical model of tuberculosis epidemics to estimate the impact of alternative future smoking trends on tuberculosis control. We projected tuberculosis incidence, prevalence, and mortality in each World Health Organization region from 2010 to 2050, and incorporated changing trends in smoking, case detection, treatment success, and HIV prevalence. RESULTS: The model predicted that smoking would produce an excess of 18 million tuberculosis cases (standard error 16-20) and 40 million deaths from tuberculosis (39-41) between 2010 and 2050, if smoking trends continued along current trajectories. The effect of smoking was anticipated to increase the number of tuberculosis cases by 7{\%} (274 million v 256 million) and deaths by 66{\%} (101 million v 61 million), compared with model predictions that did not account for smoking. Smoking was also expected to delay the millennium development goal target to reduce tuberculosis mortality by half from 1990 to 2015. The model estimated that aggressive tobacco control (achieving a 1{\%} decrease in smoking prevalence per year down to eradication) would avert 27 million smoking attributable deaths from tuberculosis by 2050. However, if the prevalence of smoking increased to 50{\%} of adults (as observed in countries with high tobacco use), the model estimated that 34 million additional deaths from tuberculosis would occur by 2050. CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco smoking could substantially increase tuberculosis cases and deaths worldwide in coming years, undermining progress towards tuberculosis mortality targets. Aggressive tobacco control could avert millions of deaths from tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Continuous differential equations are often applied to small populations with little time spent on understanding uncertainty brought about by small-population effects. Despite large numbers of individuals being latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (TB), progression from latent infection to observable disease is a relatively rare event. For small communities, this means case counts are subject to stochasticity, and deterministic models may not be appropriate tools for interpreting transmission trends. Furthermore, the nonlinear nature of the underlying dynamics means that fluctuations are autocorrelated, which can invalidate standard statistical analyses which assume independent fluctuations. Here we extend recent work using a system of differential equations to study the HIV-TB epidemic in Masiphumelele, a community near Cape Town in South Africa [Bacaer, et al., J. Mol. Biol. 57(4), 557-593] by studying the statistical properties of active TB events. We apply van Kampen's system-size (or population-size) expansion technique to obtain an approximation to a master equation describing the dynamics. We use the resulting Fokker-Planck equation and point-process theory to derive two-time correlation functions for active TB events. This method can be used to gain insight into the temporal aspect of cluster identification, which currently relies on DNA classification only.},

abstract = {The basic reproductive rate (R0) is a measure of the severity of an epidemic. On the basis of replicated Latin hypercube sampling, the authors performed an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis (TB). The uncertainty analysis allowed for the derivation of a frequency distribution for R0 and the assessment of the relative contribution each of the three components of R0 made when TB epidemics first arose centuries ago. (The three components of R0 are associated with fast, slow, and relapse TB.) R0 estimates indicated the existence of fairly severe epidemics when TB epidemics first arose. The R0 for the susceptible persons who developed TB slowly (R0(slow)) contributed the most to the R0 estimates; however, the relative R0(slow) contribution decreased as the severity of TB epidemics increased. The sensitivity of the magnitude of R0 to the uncertainty in estimating values of each of the input parameters was assessed. These results indicated that five of the nine input parameters, because of their estimation uncertainty, were influential in determining the magnitude of R0. This uncertainty and sensitivity methodology provides results that can aid investigators in understanding the historical epidemiology of TB by quantifying the effect of the transmission processes involved. Additionally, this method can be applied to the R0 of any other infectious disease to estimate the probability of an epidemic outbreak.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is seen in both the hospital and community settings. Approaches are required to minimize the increase in resistant strains, such as good antibiotic stewardship and the limiting of antibiotic use to appropriate circumstances. There are instances when drug dose and/or schedule can be used to minimize the probability that mutants will take over the bacterial population. Over the past several years, significant advances have been made in understanding the relationship between drug concentrations and amplification of resistant mutant subpopulations. In this review, we examine the use of preclinical models for facilitating this understanding. We also use mathematical techniques, including Monte Carlo simulation, to bridge between the identification of exposures to minimize resistance and the examination of candidate drug doses to achieve this end. Examples are provided for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis. In each instance, quinolone antimicrobials were examined. More investigations with other pathogens and drug classes are required.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease with a peculiar feature: Upon infection with the causative agent, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis (MTB), most hosts enter a latent state during which no transmission of MTB to new hosts occurs. Only a fraction of latently infected hosts develop TB disease and can potentially infect new hosts. At first glance, this seems like a waste of transmission potential and therefore an evolutionary suboptimal strategy for MTB. It might be that the human immune response keeps MTB in check in most hosts, thereby preventing it from achieving its evolutionary optimum. Another possible explanation is that long latency and progression to disease in only a fraction of hosts are evolutionary beneficial to MTB by allowing it to persist better in small host populations. Given that MTB has co-evolved with human hosts for millenia or longer, it likely encountered small host populations for a large share of its evolutionary history and had to evolve strategies of persistence. Here, we use a mathematical model to show that indeed, MTB persistence is optimal for an intermediate duration of latency and level of activation. The predicted optimal level of activation is above the observed value, suggesting that human co-evolution has lead to host immunity, which keeps MTB below its evolutionary optimum.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The post-2015 End TB Strategy proposes targets of 50{\%} reduction in tuberculosis incidence and 75{\%} reduction in mortality from tuberculosis by 2025. We aimed to assess whether these targets are feasible in three high-burden countries with contrasting epidemiology and previous programmatic achievements. METHODS: 11 independently developed mathematical models of tuberculosis transmission projected the epidemiological impact of currently available tuberculosis interventions for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in China, India, and South Africa. Models were calibrated with data on tuberculosis incidence and mortality in 2012. Representatives from national tuberculosis programmes and the advocacy community provided distinct country-specific intervention scenarios, which included screening for symptoms, active case finding, and preventive therapy. FINDINGS: Aggressive scale-up of any single intervention scenario could not achieve the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets in any country. However, the models projected that, in the South Africa national tuberculosis programme scenario, a combination of continuous isoniazid preventive therapy for individuals on antiretroviral therapy, expanded facility-based screening for symptoms of tuberculosis at health centres, and improved tuberculosis care could achieve a 55{\%} reduction in incidence (range 31-62{\%}) and a 72{\%} reduction in mortality (range 64-82{\%}) compared with 2015 levels. For India, and particularly for China, full scale-up of all interventions in tuberculosis-programme performance fell short of the 2025 targets, despite preventing a cumulative 3.4 million cases. The advocacy scenarios illustrated the high impact of detecting and treating latent tuberculosis. INTERPRETATION: Major reductions in tuberculosis burden seem possible with current interventions. However, additional interventions, adapted to country-specific tuberculosis epidemiology and health systems, are needed to reach the post-2015 End TB Strategy targets at country level.

abstract = {An appealing feature of multiple imputation is the simplicity of the rules for combining the multiple complete-data inferences into a final inference, the repeated-imputation inference (Rubin, 1987). This inference is based on a t distribution and is derived from a Bayesian paradigm under the assumption that the complete-data degrees of freedom, $\nu$com, are infinite, but the number of imputations, m, is finite. When $\nu$com is small and there is only a modest proportion of missing data, the calculated repeated-imputation degrees of freedom, $\nu$m, for the t reference distribution can be much larger than $\nu$com, which is clearly inappropriate. Following the Bayesian paradigm, we derive an adjusted degrees of freedom, $\nu$̃m, with the following three properties: for fixed m and estimated fraction of missing information, $\nu$̃m monotonically increases in $\nu$com; $\nu$̃m is always less than or equal to $\nu$com; and $\nu$̃m equals $\nu$m when $\nu$com is infinite. A small simulation study demonstrates the superior frequentist performance when using $\nu$̃m rather than $\nu$m.},

abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as trans-mission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in par-ameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and com-putationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the stan-dard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in esti-mates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

abstract = {HIV has increased the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) by up to sevenfold in African countries, but antiretroviral therapy (ART) reduces the incidence of AIDS-related TB. We use a mathematical model to investigate the short-term and long-term impacts of ART on the incidence of TB, assuming that people are tested for HIV once a year, on average, and start ART at a fixed time after HIV seroconversion or at a fixed CD4(+) cell count. We fit the model to trend data on HIV prevalence and TB incidence in nine countries in sub-Saharan Africa. If HIV-positive people start ART within 5 y of seroconversion, the incidence of AIDS-related TB in 2015 will be reduced by 48{\%} (range: 37-55{\%}). Long-term reductions depend sensitively on the delay to starting ART. If treatment is started 5, 2, or 1 y after HIV seroconversion, or as soon as people test positive, the incidence in 2050 will be reduced by 66{\%} (range: 57-80{\%}), 95{\%} (range: 93-96{\%}), 97.7{\%} (range: 96.9-98.2{\%}) and 98.4{\%} (range: 97.8-98.9{\%}), respectively. In the countries considered here, early ART could avert 0.71 +/- 0.36 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI)] million of 3.4 million cases of TB between 2010 and 2015 and 5.8 +/- 2.9 (95{\%} CI) million of 15 million cases between 2015 and 2050. As more countries provide ART at higher CD4(+) cell counts, the impact on TB should be investigated to test the predictions of this model.},

abstract = {Days to positivity in automated liquid mycobacterial culture have been shown to correlate with mycobacterial load and have been proposed as a useful biomarker for treatment responses in tuberculosis. However, there is currently no quantitative method or model to analyze the change in days to positivity with time on treatment. The objectives of this study were to describe the decline in numbers of mycobacteria in sputum collected once weekly for 8 weeks from patients on treatment for tuberculosis using days to positivity in liquid culture. One hundred forty-four patients with smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis were recruited from a tuberculosis clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. A nonlinear mixed-effects repeated-time-to-event modeling approach was used to analyze the time-to-positivity data. A biexponential model described the decline in the estimated number of bacteria in patients' sputum samples, while a logistic model with a lag time described the growth of the bacteria in liquid culture. At baseline, the estimated number of rapidly killed bacteria is typically 41 times higher than that of those that are killed slowly. The time to kill half of the rapidly killed bacteria was about 1.8 days, while it was 39 days for slowly killed bacteria. Patients with lung cavitation had higher bacterial loads than patients without lung cavitation. The model successfully described the increase in days to positivity as treatment progressed, differentiating between bacteria that are killed rapidly and those that are killed slowly. Our model can be used to analyze similar data from studies testing new drug regimens.},

abstract = {The target for TB elimination is to reduce annual incidence to less than one case per million population by 2050. Meeting that target requires a 1,000-fold reduction in incidence in little more than 35 years. This can be achieved only by combining the effective treatment of active TB-early case detection and high cure rates to interrupt transmission-with methods to prevent new infections and to neutralize existing latent infections. Vigorous implementation of the WHO Stop TB Strategy is needed to achieve the former, facilitated by the effective supply of, and demand for, health services. The latter calls for new technology, including biomarkers of TB risk, diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines. An important milestone en route to elimination will be reached when there is less than 1 TB death per 100,000 population, marking entry into the elimination phase. This landmark can be reached by many countries within 1-2 decades.},

abstract = {One third of the world's population is affected by tuberculosis (TB). This pandemic presents several challenges to the health professionals. Hence, forecasting and controlling TB epidemics play an important role to deal with this disease. Transmission models are valuable tools for projecting and evaluating control strategies against TB, but lack capability to easily integrate noisy information from epidemiological data into projections and policy analysis. To overcome this shortcoming, a dynamical system for TB based on particle filtering algorithm was developed. We evaluated the effectiveness of different levels of particle filtering by running the particle filter to year 2000, then disabling it and judging the discrepancy of model predictions vs. observed data for the period 2000-2007. The successive results revealed similar patterns including a rise in force of infection during the 1990s, but considering successively larger sets of observations yielded smaller discrepancies between particle filtered projections and observed data.},

Depending on levels of HAART population coverage, increasing MDRTB cure rates from 5{\%} to 80{\%} reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 1{\%} and 13{\%}. High population coverage with HAART (75{\%} or higher), allied with high MDRTB cure rates, reduces cumulative deaths by 60{\%}, with limited impact below this level. High coverage with HAART is required to substantially reduce the number of deaths from tuberculosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-effectiveness of three diagnostic algorithms incorporating a new rapid test, FASTPlaqueTB, with the current National TB Control Programme (NTCP) algorithm for diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in new smear-negative suspects in South Africa. DESIGN: A model of the outcome of patients screened using each diagnostic algorithm was established using published costs and performance data for each component of the algorithm. Direct health care provider costs associated with provision of each diagnostic strategy were determined. Overall performance, total cost, speed and accuracy of diagnosis were estimated for screening 1000 new TB suspects using each algorithm. RESULTS: The use of FASTPlaqueTB and culture algorithms enabled 28{\%} more smear-negative TB patients to be diagnosed overall and was cheaper to implement than the NTCP algorithm (18,312-18,581 US dollars compared with 20,079 dollars). Fewer clinic visits were required to establish a diagnosis, reducing clinic workload and patient costs. FASTPlaqueTB enabled rapid and specific diagnosis of at least 50{\%} of smear-negative TB patients within 2 days. CONCLUSIONS: The use of FASTPlaqueTB can assist in improving existing case detection strategies and may be cost-effectively integrated into the current diagnostic infrastructure, offering patients more rapid and reliable diagnosis whilst reducing the overall cost.},

abstract = {The long-term persistence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in communities with high tuberculosis prevalence is a serious problem aggravated by the presence of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains. Drug resistance in an individual patient is often discovered only after a long delay, particularly if the diagnosis is based on current culture-based drug sensitivity testing methods. During such delays, the patient may transmit tuberculosis to his or her contacts. Rapid diagnosis of drug resistance would be expected to reduce this transmission and hence to decrease the prevalence of drug-resistant strains. To investigate this quantitatively, a mathematical model was constructed, assuming a homogeneous population structure typical of communities in South Africa where tuberculosis incidence is high. Computer simulations performed with this model showed that current control strategies will not halt the spread of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis in such communities. The simulations showed that the rapid diagnosis of drug resistance can be expected to reduce the incidence of drug-resistant cases provided the additional measure of screening within the community is implemented.},

abstract = {Ebola emerged in West Africa around December 2013 and swept through Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia, giving rise to 27,748 confirmed, probable and suspected cases reported by 29 July 2015. Case diagnoses during the epidemic have relied on polymerase chain reaction-based tests. Owing to limited laboratory capacity and local transport infrastructure, the delays from sample collection to test results being available have often been 2 days or more. Point-of-care rapid diagnostic tests offer the potential to substantially reduce these delays. We review Ebola rapid diagnostic tests approved by the World Health Organization and those currently in development. Such rapid diagnostic tests could allow early triaging of patients, thereby reducing the potential for nosocomial transmission. In addition, despite the lower test accuracy, rapid diagnostic test-based diagnosis may be beneficial in some contexts because of the reduced time spent by uninfected individuals in health-care settings where they may be at increased risk of infection; this also frees up hospital beds. We use mathematical modelling to explore the potential benefits of diagnostic testing strategies involving rapid diagnostic tests alone and in combination with polymerase chain reaction testing. Our analysis indicates that the use of rapid diagnostic tests with sensitivity and specificity comparable with those currently under development always enhances control, whether evaluated at a health-care-unit or population level. If such tests had been available throughout the recent epidemic, we estimate, for Sierra Leone, that their use in combination with confirmatory polymerase chain-reaction testing might have reduced the scale of the epidemic by over a third.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: We undertook a decision analysis to evaluate the economic and health effects and incremental cost-effectiveness of using targeted tuberculin skin testing, compared with universal screening or no screening, before kindergarten. METHODS: We constructed a decision tree to determine the costs and clinical outcomes of using targeted testing compared with universal screening or no screening. Baseline estimates for input parameters were taken from the medical literature and from California health jurisdiction data. Sensitivity analyses were performed to determine plausible ranges of associated outcomes and costs. We surveyed California health jurisdictions to determine the prevalence of mandatory universal tuberculin skin testing. RESULTS: In our base-case scenario, the cost to prevent an additional case of tuberculosis by using targeted testing, compared with no screening, was {\$}524,897. The cost to prevent an additional case by using universal screening, compared with targeted testing, was {\$}671,398. The incremental cost of preventing a case through screening remained above {\$}100,000 unless the prevalence of tuberculin skin testing positivity increased to {\textgreater}10{\%}. More than 51{\%} of children entering kindergarten in California live where tuberculin skin testing is mandatory. CONCLUSIONS: The cost to prevent a case of tuberculosis by using either universal screening or targeted testing of kindergarteners is high. If targeted testing replaced universal tuberculin skin testing in California, then {\$}1.27 million savings per year would be generated for more cost-effective strategies to prevent tuberculosis. Improving the positive predictive value of the risk factor tool or applying it to groups with higher prevalence of latent tuberculosis would make its use more cost-effective. Universal tuberculin skin testing should be discontinued, and targeted testing should be considered only when the prevalence of risk factor positivity and the prevalence of tuberculin skin testing positivity among risk factor-positive individuals are high enough to meet acceptable thresholds for cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of optimal control of a deterministic model of tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus). We first present and analyze an uncontrolled tuberculosis model which incorporates the essential biological and epidemiological features of the disease. The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated basic reproduction number is less than the unity. Based on this continuous model, the tuberculosis control is formulated and solved as an optimal control problem, indicating how control terms on the chemoprophylaxis and detection should be introduced in the population to reduce the number of individuals with active TB. Results provide a framework for designing the cost-effective strategies for TB with two intervention methods. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Approximately 100 million newborn children receive Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) annually, because vaccination is consistently protective against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB. By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%}, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission-Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US{\$}1-10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10{\%} and 80{\%} with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US{\$}116 and US{\$}9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US{\$}52-{\$}4540. At 80{\%} efficacy, revaccination averted 17{\%} of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.},

abstract = {The NF-kappaB signaling pathway is central to the body's response to many pathogens. Mathematical models based on cell culture experiments have identified important molecular mechanisms controlling the dynamics of NF-kappaB signaling, but the dynamics of this pathway have never been studied in the context of an infection in a host. Here, we incorporate these dynamics into a virtual infection setting. We build a multi-scale model of the immune response to the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) to explore the impact of NF-kappaB dynamics occurring across molecular, cellular, and tissue scales in the lung. NF-kappaB signaling is triggered via tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) binding to receptors on macrophages; TNF has been shown to play a key role in infection dynamics in humans and multiple animal systems. Using our multi-scale model, we predict the impact of TNF-induced NF-kappaB-mediated responses on the outcome of infection at the level of a granuloma, an aggregate of immune cells and bacteria that forms in response to infection and is key to containment of infection and clinical latency. We show how the stability of mRNA transcripts corresponding to NF-kappaB-mediated responses significantly controls bacterial load in a granuloma, inflammation level in tissue, and granuloma size. Because we incorporate intracellular signaling pathways explicitly, our analysis also elucidates NF-kappaB-associated signaling molecules and processes that may be new targets for infection control.},

In this study we present an epidemiological model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection to investigate the effects of host genetics and demographic factors on epidemic TB. We discuss the general framework for this approach and present analytical results to identify important parameters affecting steady-state prevalence and incidence rates of TB disease. We then use numerical simulations of our model to observe the effects of a genetically susceptible subpopulation on TB disease dynamics at the population level. Finally, we simulate infection within a genetically heterogeneous population in two demographic settings: India (a typical population with high TB prevalence) and the USA (a typical population with low TB prevalence). Results show that changes in transmission parameters, the fraction of the population genetically susceptible to infection, and demographic factors strongly affect TB prevalence and incidence rates.},

Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {Knowing how to control a pathogen that infects more than one host species is of increasing importance because the incidence of such infections grows with continuing environmental change. Of concern are infections transmitted from wildlife to humans or livestock. To determine which options are available to control a pathogen in these circumstances, we analyze the pathogen invasion matrix for the multihost susceptible-infected-susceptible model. We highlight the importance of both community structure and the column sum or row sum index, an indicator of both force of infection and community stability. We derive a set of guidelines for constructing culling strategies and suggest a hybrid strategy that has the advantages of both the bottom-up and the top-down approaches, which we study in some detail. The analysis holds for an arbitrary number of host species, enabling the analysis of large-scale ecological systems and systems with spatial dimensions. We test the robustness of our methods by making two changes in the structure of the underlying dynamic model, adding direct competition and introducing frequency-dependent infection transmission. In particular, we show that the introduction of an additional host can eliminate the pathogen rather than eliminate the resident host. The discussion is illustrated with a reference to bovine tuberculosis.},

However, the potential population-level effects of preventative therapy (PT) on the prevalence of drug resistance are not well understood. PT can directly affect the rate at which resistance is acquired among those receiving PT. It can also indirectly affect resistance by altering the rate at which resistance is acquired through treatment for active disease and by modifying the level of competition between transmission of drug-resistant and drug-sensitive pathogens. We propose a general mathematical model to explore the ways in which PT can affect the long-term prevalence of drug resistance. Depending on the relative contributions of these three mechanisms, we find that increasing the level of coverage of PT may result in increases, decreases or non-monotonic changes in the overall prevalence of drug resistance. These results demonstrate the complexity of the relationship between PT and drug resistance in the population. Care should be taken when predicting population-level changes in drug resistance from small pilot studies of PT or estimates based solely on its direct effects.},

METHODS AND FINDINGS: We estimate the impact of the introduction of Xpert on the costs and cost-effectiveness of TB care using decision analytic modelling, comparing the introduction of Xpert to a base case of smear microscopy and clinical diagnosis in India, South Africa, and Uganda. The introduction of Xpert increases TB case finding in all three settings; from 72{\%}-85{\%} to 95{\%}-99{\%} of the cohort of individuals with suspected TB, compared to the base case. Diagnostic costs (including the costs of testing all individuals with suspected TB) also increase: from US{\$}28-US{\$}49 to US{\$}133-US{\$}146 and US{\$}137-US{\$}151 per TB case detected when Xpert is used "in addition to" and "as a replacement of" smear microscopy, respectively. The incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for using Xpert "in addition to" smear microscopy, compared to the base case, range from US{\$}41-{\$}110 per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted. Likewise the ICERS for using Xpert "as a replacement of" smear microscopy range from US{\$}52-{\$}138 per DALY averted. These ICERs are below the World Health Organization (WHO) willingness to pay threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that Xpert is a cost-effective method of TB diagnosis, compared to a base case of smear microscopy and clinical diagnosis of smear-negative TB in low- and middle-income settings where, with its ability to substantially increase case finding, it has important potential for improving TB diagnosis and control. The extent of cost-effectiveness gain to TB programmes from deploying Xpert is primarily dependent on current TB diagnostic practices. Further work is required during scale-up to validate these findings.},

abstract = {As an emergent infectious disease outbreak unfolds, public health response is reliant on information on key epidemiological quantities, such as transmission potential and serial interval. Increasingly, transmission models fit to incidence data are used to estimate these parameters and guide policy. Some widely used modelling practices lead to potentially large errors in parameter estimates and, consequently, errors in model-based forecasts. Even more worryingly, in such situations, confidence in parameter estimates and forecasts can itself be far overestimated, leading to the potential for large errors that mask their own presence. Fortunately, straightforward and computationally inexpensive alternatives exist that avoid these problems. Here, we first use a simulation study to demonstrate potential pitfalls of the standard practice of fitting deterministic models to cumulative incidence data. Next, we demonstrate an alternative based on stochastic models fit to raw data from an early phase of 2014 West Africa Ebola virus disease outbreak. We show not only that bias is thereby reduced, but that uncertainty in estimates and forecasts is better quantified and that, critically, lack of model fit is more readily diagnosed. We conclude with a short list of principles to guide the modelling response to future infectious disease outbreaks.},

In particular, we investigate the mechanisms by which bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium leprae persist at low densities for extended periods, and attain high densities much later. We suggest that the persistence of bacteria in face of immune pressure may result from the bacteria having a very slow growth rate, or having a dormant stage. We show that whereas these mechanisms may lead to long-term persistence, this will be obtained at relatively low densities. We then suggest that the long-term persistence of bacteria may result in the loss of immunity because of the deletion of specific T-cells arriving from the thymus, and the exhaustion of the specific T-cells as these cells reach the Hayflick limit and die. This loss of immunity will allow the bacteria to attain a high density. We propose experiments capable of testing our models and discuss the implications of the models for the treatment of infected hosts.},

abstract = {Molecular epidemiologic studies may use genotypic clustering of isolates as an indicator of recent transmission. It has been shown that missing cases lead to underestimating clustering, and modelling studies suggested that they may also lead to underestimating odds ratios for clustering. Using a national, comprehensive database from the Netherlands covering 15 years between 1993 and 2007 and including over 12,000 patients and their isolates, the authors determined the effects of sampling at random, in time, and by geographic area. As expected, sampling reduced the observed clustering percentages. However, sampling did not reduce the observed odds ratios for clustering. The main explanations for this discrepancy with model outcomes were that a substantial proportion of clustered cases were found in large clusters and that risk factors for clustering tended to be-among clustered cases-also risk factors for large clusters. The authors conclude that, in settings where risk factors for clustering may be interpreted as risk factors for recent transmission, these risk factors are also associated with larger cluster sizes. As a result, odds ratios would show limited sampling bias.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Isoniazid preventive therapy is effective in reducing the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in persons living with HIV (PLWH); however, screening must exclude TB disease before initiating therapy. Symptom screening alone may be insufficient to exclude TB disease in PLWH because some PLWH with TB disease have no symptoms. The addition of chest radiography (CXR) may improve disease detection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present analysis was to compare the costs and effects of the addition of CXR to the symptom screening process against the costs and effects of symptom screening alone. METHODS: Using data from Botswana, a decision analytic model was used to compare a "Symptom only" policy against a "Symptom+CXR" policy. The outcomes of interest were cost, death, and isoniazid- and multidrug-resistant TB in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 PLWH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Symptom+CXR policy prevented 16 isoniazid- and 0.3 multidrug-resistant TB cases; however, because of attrition from the screening process, there were 98 excess cases of TB, 15 excess deaths, and an additional cost of U.S. {\$}127,100. The Symptom+CXR policy reduced deaths only if attrition was close to zero; however, to eliminate attrition the cost would be U.S. {\$}2.8 million per death averted. These findings did not change in best- and worst-case scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In Botswana, a policy with symptom screening only preceding isoniazid-preventive therapy initiation prevents more TB and TB-related deaths, and uses fewer resources, than a policy that uses both CXR and symptom screening.},

abstract = {The WHO recommends integrating interventions to address the devastating TB/HIV co-epidemics in South Africa, yet integration has been poorly implemented and TB/HIV control efforts need strengthening. Identifying infected individuals is particularly difficult in rural settings. We used mathematical modeling to predict the impact of community-based, integrated TB/HIV case finding and additional control strategies on South Africa's TB/HIV epidemics. We developed a model incorporating TB and HIV transmission to evaluate the effectiveness of integrating TB and HIV interventions in rural South Africa over 10 years. We modeled the impact of a novel screening program that integrates case finding for TB and HIV in the community, comparing it to status quo and recommended TB/HIV control strategies, including GeneXpert, MDR-TB treatment decentralization, improved first-line TB treatment cure rate, isoniazid preventive therapy, and expanded ART. Combining recommended interventions averted 27{\%} of expected TB cases (95{\%} CI 18-40{\%}) 18{\%} HIV (95{\%} CI 13-24{\%}), 60{\%} MDR-TB (95{\%} CI 34-83{\%}), 69{\%} XDR-TB (95{\%} CI 34-90{\%}), and 16{\%} TB/HIV deaths (95{\%} CI 12-29). Supplementing these interventions with annual community-based TB/HIV case finding averted a further 17{\%} of TB cases (44{\%} total; 95{\%} CI 31-56{\%}), 5{\%} HIV (23{\%} total; 95{\%} CI 17-29{\%}), 8{\%} MDR-TB (68{\%} total; 95{\%} CI 40-88{\%}), 4{\%} XDR-TB (73{\%} total; 95{\%} CI 38-91{\%}), and 8{\%} TB/HIV deaths (24{\%} total; 95{\%} CI 16-39{\%}). In addition to increasing screening frequency, we found that improving TB symptom questionnaire sensitivity, second-line TB treatment delays, default before initiating TB treatment or ART, and second-line TB drug efficacy were significantly associated with even greater reductions in TB and HIV cases. TB/HIV epidemics in South Africa were most effectively curtailed by simultaneously implementing interventions that integrated community-based TB/HIV control strategies and targeted drug-resistant TB. Strengthening existing TB and HIV treatment programs is needed to further reduce disease incidence.},

abstract = {SETTING: Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is provided to all infants born in Finland. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of universal versus selective BCG immunization. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to simulate rates of tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (NTM), and to examine the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per case averted of three different strategies: universal BCG, selective BCG (10{\%} of infants at higher TB risk than other infants) or no BCG immunization. RESULTS: In a cohort of 60,000 infants over 15 years, the model predicts five cases each of TB and NTM disease with universal immunization, 8-21 TB and 31 NTM cases with various strategies of selective immunization, and 25 TB and 34 NTM cases with no BCG immunization. BCG side-effects are predicted in 5, 0.5 and 0 infants, respectively. The cost per case averted for immunization strategies ranges from a cost of 38,311 US dollars to a savings of 323 dollars as selective immunization becomes more efficient at targeting infants at highest risk of TB. CONCLUSIONS: In a country with a low incidence of pediatric tuberculosis, selective BCG immunization is a more cost-effective strategy than universal BCG immunization for the prevention of tuberculosis, but results in an increase in NTM cases.},

Globally, 6.7 million new cases of tuberculosis and 2.4 million deaths from tuberculosis are estimated for 1998.

Active case-finding by using mass miniature radiography could save 23 million lives over this period. A single contact treatment for tuberculosis could avert 24 million cases and 11 million deaths; combined with active screening, it could reduce mortality by nearly 40{\%}. A new vaccine with 50{\%} efficacy could lower incidence by 36 million cases and mortality by 9 million deaths.

From the stability analysis of the disease free equilibrium, by applying Routh-Hurwitz criteria, a threshold is obtained, which is called the basic reproduction number. However, the application of spectral radius theory on the next generation matrix provides a different expression for the basic reproduction number, that is, the square root of the previously found formula. If the spectral radius of the next generation matrix is defined as the geometric mean of partial reproduction numbers, however the product of these partial numbers is the basic reproduction number, then both methods provide the same expression. In order to show this statement, dengue transmission modelling incorporating or not the transovarian transmission is considered as a case study. Also tuberculosis transmission and sexually transmitted infection modellings are taken as further examples.},

abstract = {A deterministic model for evaluating the impact of voluntary testing and treatment on the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis is formulated and analyzed. The epidemiological threshold, known as the reproduction number is derived and qualitatively used to investigate the existence and stability of the associated equilibrium of the model system. The disease-free equilibrium is shown to be locally-asymptotically stable when the reproductive number is less than unity, and unstable if this threshold parameter exceeds unity. It is shown, using the Centre Manifold theory, that the model undergoes the phenomenon of backward bifurcation where the stable disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction number is less than unity. The analysis of the reproduction number suggests that voluntary tuberculosis testing and treatment may lead to effective control of tuberculosis. Furthermore, numerical simulations support the fact that an increase voluntary tuberculosis testing and treatment have a positive impact in controlling the spread of tuberculosis in the community.},

Using a model of introduction and transmission of strains with different DNA fingerprint patterns, we show that the properties and interpretation of clustering statistics may differ substantially between settings. For some unindustrialized countries, where the annual risk for infection has changed little over time, 70{\%} to 80{\%} of all age groups may be clustered during a 3-year period, which underestimates the proportion of disease attributable to recent transmission. In contrast, for a typical industrialized setting (the Netherlands), clustering declines with increasing age (from 75{\%} to 15{\%} among young and old patients, respectively) and underestimates the extent of recent transmission only for young patients. We conclude that, in some settings, clustering is an unreliable indicator of the extent of recent transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid) disease, is associated with a worse patient outcome. Drug resistance diagnosed using microbiological culture takes days to weeks, as TB bacteria grow slowly. Rapid molecular tests for drug resistance detection (1 day) are commercially available and may promote faster initiation of appropriate treatment. OBJECTIVES: To (1) conduct a systematic review of evidence regarding diagnostic accuracy of molecular genetic tests for drug resistance, (2) conduct a health-economic evaluation of screening and diagnostic strategies, including comparison of alternative models of service provision and assessment of the value of targeting rapid testing at high-risk subgroups, and (3) construct a transmission-dynamic mathematical model that translates the estimates of diagnostic accuracy into estimates of clinical impact. REVIEW METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: A standardised search strategy identified relevant studies from EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, Bioscience Information Service (BIOSIS), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe Social Policy {\&} Practice (SIGLE) and Web of Science, published between 1 January 2000 and 15 August 2013. Additional 'grey' sources were included. Quality was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies version 2 (QUADAS-2). For each diagnostic strategy and population subgroup, a care pathway was constructed to specify which medical treatments and health services that individuals would receive from presentation to the point where they either did or did not complete TB treatment successfully. A total cost was estimated from a health service perspective for each care pathway, and the health impact was estimated in terms of the mean discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost as a result of disease and treatment. Costs and QALYs were both discounted at 3.5{\%} per year. An integrated transmission-dynamic and economic model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing rapid molecular testing (in addition to culture and drug sensitivity testing). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact on cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and treatment time delays, diagnosis and treatment costs, and associated QALYs. RESULTS: A total of 8922 titles and abstracts were identified, with 557 papers being potentially eligible. Of these, 56 studies contained sufficient test information for analysis. All three commercial tests performed well when detecting drug resistance in clinical samples, although with evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Pooled sensitivity for GenoType(R) MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) (isoniazid and rifampicin resistance), INNO-LiPA Rif.TB(R) (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) (rifampicin resistance) and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (rifampicin resistance) was 83.4{\%}, 94.6{\%}, 95.4{\%} and 96.8{\%}, respectively; equivalent pooled specificity was 99.6{\%}, 98.2{\%}, 99.7{\%} and 98.4{\%}, respectively. Results of the transmission model suggest that all of the rapid assays considered here, if added to the current diagnostic pathway, would be cost-saving and achieve a reduction in expected QALY loss compared with current practice. GenoType MTBDRplus appeared to be the most cost-effective of the rapid tests in the South Asian population, although results were similar for GeneXpert. In all other scenarios GeneXpert appeared to be the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid molecular tests for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance were sensitive and specific. They may also be cost-effective when added to culture drug susceptibility testing in the UK. There is global interest in point-of-care testing and further work is needed to review the performance of emerging tests and the wider health-economic impact of decentralised testing in clinics and primary care, as well as non-health-care settings, such as shelters and prisons.

Estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 are derived, taking into account model uncertainty and individual heterogeneity in contact rates. Twenty-two models are documented, for which publication frequency and expert opinion are negatively correlated. Using the expert prior with individual heterogeneity, R0=6.1 [95{\%} credible region (CR) 4.3-9.2] for rubella and R0=19.3 (95{\%} CR 4.0-31.5) for mumps. The posterior modes are insensitive to the prior for rubella but not for mumps. Overall, assortative models with individual heterogeneity are recommended.},

abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a growing impediment to the control of infectious diseases worldwide, tuberculosis (TB) being among them. TB kills two million people each year and foci of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) have been identified in Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Latin America. A critical question for health policy is whether standardized short-course chemotherapy for TB, based on cheap first-line drugs, can prevent and reverse the spread of drug resistance. Here we use mathematical modeling, in conjunction with treatment results from six countries, to show that best-practice short-course chemotherapy is highly likely to bring strains resistant to either of the two key drugs isoniazid and rifampicin under control and to prevent the emergence of MDR-TB. However, it is not certain to contain MDR-TB once it has emerged, partly because cure rates are too low. We estimate that approximately 70{\%} of prevalent, infectious MDR-TB cases should be detected and treated each year, and at least 80{\%} of these cases should be cured, in order to prevent outbreaks of MDR-TB. Poor control programs should aim to increase case detection and cure rates together for three reasons: (i) these variables act synergistically; (ii) when either is low, the other cannot succeed alone; and (iii) the second-line drugs needed to raise MDR-TB cure rates are few and extremely costly. We discuss the implications of these results for World Health Organization policy on the management of antibiotic resistance.},

abstract = {To aid the creation of novel antituberculosis (antiTB) compounds, Bayesian models were derived and validated on a data set of 3779 compounds which have been measured for minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain. The model development and validation involved exploring six different training sets and 15 fingerprint types which resulted in a total of 90 models, with active compounds defined as those with MIC {\textless} 5 microM. The best model was derived using Extended Class Fingerprints of maximum diameter 12 (ECFP{\_}12) and a few global descriptors on a training set derived using Functional Class Fingerprints of maximum diameter 4 (FCFP{\_}4). This model demonstrated very good discriminant ability in general, with excellent discriminant statistics for the training set (total accuracy: 0.968; positive recall: 0.967) and a good predictive ability for the test set (total accuracy: 0.869; positive recall: 0.789). The good predictive ability was maintained when the model was applied to a well-separated test set of 2880 compounds derived from a commercial database (total accuracy: 0.73; positive recall: 0.72). The model revealed several conserved substructures present in the active and inactive compounds which are believed to have incremental and detrimental effects on the MIC, respectively. Strategies for enhancing the repertoire of antiTB compounds with the model, including virtual screening of large databases and combinatorial library design, are proposed.},

@article{Huppert2013,
abstract = {We discuss to what extent disease transmission models provide reliable predictions. The concept of prediction is delineated as it is understood by modellers, and illustrated by some classic and recent examples. A precondition for a model to provide valid predictions is that the assumptions underlying it correspond to the reality, but such correspondence is always limited—all models are simplifications of reality. A central tenet of the modelling enterprise is what we may call the 'robustness thesis': a model whose assumptions approximately correspond to reality will make predictions that are approximately valid. To examine which of the predictions made by a model are trustworthy, it is essential to examine the outcomes of different models. Thus, if a highly simplified model makes a prediction, and if the same or a very similar prediction is made by a more elaborate model that includes some mechanisms or details that the first model did not, then we gain some confidence that the prediction is robust. An important benefit derived from mathematical modelling activity is that it demands transparency and accuracy regarding our assumptions, thus enabling us to test our understanding of the disease epidemiology by comparing model results and observed patterns. Models can also assist in decision-making by making projections regarding important issues such as intervention-induced changes in the spread of disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The patterns of relative species abundance are commonly studied in ecology and epidemiology to provide insights into underlying dynamical processes. Molecular types (MVLA-types) of Mycobacterium bovis, the causal agent of bovine tuberculosis, are now routinely recorded in culture-confirmed bovine tuberculosis cases in Northern Ireland. In this study, we use ecological approaches and simulation modelling to investigate the distribution of relative abundances of MVLA-types and its potential drivers. We explore four biologically plausible hypotheses regarding the processes driving molecular type relative abundances: sampling and speciation; structuring of the pathogen population; historical changes in population size; and transmission heterogeneity (superspreading). RESULTS: Northern Irish herd-level MVLA-type surveillance shows a right-skewed distribution of MVLA-types, with a small number of types present at very high frequencies and the majority of types very rare. We demonstrate that this skew is too extreme to be accounted for by simple neutral ecological processes. Simulation results indicate that the process of MVLA-type speciation and the manner in which the MVLA-typing loci were chosen in Northern Ireland cannot account for the observed skew. Similarly, we find that pathogen population structure, assuming for example a reservoir of infection in a separate host, would drive the relative abundance distribution in the opposite direction to that observed, generating more even abundances of molecular types. However, we find that historical increases in bovine tuberculosis prevalence and/or transmission heterogeneity (superspreading) are both capable of generating the skewed MVLA-type distribution, consistent with findings of previous work examining the distribution of molecular types in human tuberculosis. CONCLUSION: Although the distribution of MVLA-type abundances does not fit classical neutral predictions, our simulations show that increases in pathogen population size and/or superspreading are consistent with the pattern observed, even in the absence of selective pressures acting on the system.},

abstract = {The purposes of this study are to predict the future trend of drug-sensitive and resistant tuberculosis (TB) in Thailand, and to assess the impact of different control strategies on the generation of drug resistant TB, through the use of mathematical analysis. We assume that the present status of TB and the emergence of drug-resistant TB in Thailand are the consequence of past epidemics. Control strategies in the model are defined by specifying the value of the effective treatment rate (baseline value = 0.74) and the relative treatment efficacy (baseline value = 0.84). It is predicted that the total number of new TB cases would continue to decrease at the current level of intervention. Although a dramatic decline in the incidence rate of drug-sensitive cases is expected, drug-resistant cases are predicted to increase gradually, so that more than half of the TB strains would not be drug-sensitive after 2020. The prediction is not greatly altered by improving the interventions. They could, however, delay the emergence of drug-resistant strains for a few years. Our study demonstrates it would be impossible to avoid the continued emergence of drug-resistant TB in the future. It is pointed out that there are urgent needs to ensure adequate supervision and monitoring, to insure treatment of 100{\%} of the targeted population with Directly Observed Therapy.},

abstract = {Epidemics of HIV/AIDS have increased the tuberculosis (TB) case-load by five or more times in East Africa and southern Africa. As HIV continues to spread, warnings have been issued of disastrous AIDS and TB epidemics in "new-wave" countries, including India, which accounts for 20{\%} of all new TB cases arising in the world each year. Here we investigate whether, in the face of the HIV epidemic, India's Revised National TB Control Program (RNTCP) could halve TB prevalence and death rates in the period 1990-2015, as specified by the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Using a mathematical model to capture the spatial and temporal variation in TB and HIV in India, we predict that, without the RNTCP, HIV would increase TB prevalence (by 1{\%}), incidence (by 12{\%}), and mortality rates (by 33{\%}) between 1990 and 2015. With the RNTCP, however, we expect substantial reductions in prevalence (by 68{\%}), incidence (by 41{\%}), and mortality (by 39{\%}) between 1990 and 2015. In India, 29{\%} of adults but 72{\%} of HIV-positive adults live in four large states in the south where, even with the RNTCP, mortality is expected to fall by only 15{\%} between 1990 and 2015. Nationally, the RNTCP should be able to reverse the increases in TB burden due to HIV but, to ensure that TB mortality is reduced by 50{\%} or more by 2015, HIV-infected TB patients should be provided with antiretroviral therapy in addition to the recommended treatment for TB.},

abstract = {SETTING: The global target of tuberculosis (TB) elimination by 2050 requires new approaches. Active case finding plus mass prophylactic treatment has been disappointing. We consider mass full anti-tuberculosis treatment as an approach to TB elimination in Kiribati, a Pacific Island nation, with a persistent epidemic of high TB incidence. OBJECTIVE: To construct a mathematical model to predict whether mass treatment with a full course of anti-tuberculosis drugs might eliminate TB from the defined population of the Republic of Kiribati. METHODS: We constructed a seven-state compartmental model of the life cycle of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in which active TB disease arises from the progression of infection, reinfection, reactivation and relapse, while distinguishing infectious from non-infectious disease. We evaluated the effects of 5-yearly mass treatment using a range of parameter values to generate outcomes in uncertainty analysis. RESULTS: Assuming population-wide treatment effectiveness for latent tuberculous infection and active TB of 90{\%}, annual TB incidence is expected to fall sharply at each 5-yearly round of treatment, approaching elimination in two decades. The model showed that the incidence rate is sensitive to the relapse rate after successful treatment of TB. CONCLUSION: Mass treatment may help to eliminate TB, at least for discrete or geographically isolated populations.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis results in an estimated 1??7 million deaths each year and the worldwide number of new cases (more than 9 million) is higher than at any other time in history. 22 low-income and middle-income countries account for more than 80 of the active cases in the world. Due to the devastating effect of HIV on susceptibility to tuberculosis, sub-Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected and accounts for four of every five cases of HIV-associated tuberculosis. In many regions highly endemic for tuberculosis, diagnosis continues to rely on century-old sputum microscopy; there is no vaccine with adequate effectiveness and tuberculosis treatment regimens are protracted and have a risk of toxic effects. Increasing rates of drug-resistant tuberculosis in eastern Europe, Asia, and sub-Saharan Africa now threaten to undermine the gains made by worldwide tuberculosis control programmes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is good evidence that diabetes is a risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis. In England, the rates of both diabetes and tuberculosis vary markedly by ethnic group. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the proportion of incident cases of pulmonary tuberculosis attributable to diabetes (population attributable fraction, PAF) for Asian, black and white men and women aged {\textgreater} or = 15 years in England. METHODS: An epidemiological model was constructed using data on the incidence of tuberculosis, the prevalence of diabetes, the population structure for 2005 and the age-specific relative risk of tuberculosis associated with diabetes from a large cohort study. RESULTS: The estimated PAF of diabetes for pulmonary tuberculosis is highest for Asian men (19.6{\%}, 95{\%} CI 10.9{\%} to 33.1{\%}) and women (14.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI 7.1{\%} to 26.5{\%}). The PAF for all ages is similar in white and black men (6.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI 3.1{\%} to 12.4{\%} and 7.4{\%}, 95{\%} CI 4.6{\%} to 12.9{\%}, respectively) and women (8.2{\%}, 95{\%} CI 3.0{\%} to 15.6{\%} and 8.9{\%}, 95{\%} CI 5.3{\%} to 15.6{\%}, respectively). The similarity of these overall figures, despite a higher prevalence of diabetes in the black population, reflects a much younger mean age of pulmonary tuberculosis in the black population. Overall, of 3461 new cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in England in 2005, 384 (202-780) were estimated to be attributable to diabetes. CONCLUSION: Given the nature of the data available, considerable uncertainty surrounds these estimates. Nonetheless, they highlight the potential importance of diabetes as a risk factor for pulmonary tuberculosis, particularly in groups at high risk of both diseases. Further research to examine the implications of these findings for tuberculosis control is urgently needed.},

Due to the devastating effect of HIV on susceptibility to tuberculosis, sub-Saharan Africa has been disproportionately affected and accounts for four of every five cases of HIV-associated tuberculosis. In many regions highly endemic for tuberculosis, diagnosis continues to rely on century-old sputum microscopy; there is no vaccine with adequate effectiveness and tuberculosis treatment regimens are protracted and have a risk of toxic effects.

abstract = {Hubbell's neutral model is increasingly applied in both theoretical and empirical studies but so far little attention has been paid to the ecological mechanisms that determine species diversity in neutral communities. In this contribution we use a stochastic individual-based Markovian model to provide an explicit derivation of Hubbell's local community model from the fundamental processes of reproduction, mortality, and immigration, and show that such derivation provides important insights on the mechanisms regulating species diversity that cannot be obtained from the original model and its previous extensions. One important insight is that the basic parameters of Hubbell's model, community size (J) and the probability that a dying individual will be replaced by an immigrant (m), cannot be considered independent and that their interdependency leads to a counterintuitive trade-off between community size and species diversity. We further demonstrate that Hubbell's treatment of community size as a free parameter hides fundamental mechanisms that influence species diversity through their effect on the size of the community. For example, while in Hubbell's model immigration can only increase species diversity by promoting colonization rates, the demographic derivation shows that immigration can also promote species diversity by reducing extinction rates. Our demographic derivation also unifies previous contrasting predictions about the effect of reproduction on species diversity by showing that both positive and negative effects are possible, and that the balance between the two effects depends on the size of the community. The demographic derivation also reconciles an apparent contradiction between Hubbell's theory and patch occupancy theory, and integrates three previously proposed mechanisms of species diversity, the More Individuals Hypothesis, the rescue effect, and the dilution effect, within a single, unified framework. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as "one-third" of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0{\%} (95{\%} uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4{\%}-26.4{\%}), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80{\%} of those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8{\%} (95{\%} UI: 0.7{\%}-0.9{\%}) of the global population, amounting to 55.5 (95{\%} UI: 48.2-63.8) million individuals currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9{\%} (95{\%} UI:10.2{\%}-11.8{\%}) was isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. CONCLUSIONS: We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) and under-nutrition are widespread in many low and middle-income countries. Momentum to prioritize under-nutrition has been growing at an international level, as demonstrated by the "Scaling Up Nutrition" movement. Low body mass index is an important risk factor for developing TB disease. The objective of this study was to project future trends in TB related outcomes under different scenarios for reducing under-nutrition in the adult population in the Central Eastern states of India. METHODS: A compartmental TB transmission model stratified by body mass index was parameterized using national and regional data from India. We compared TB related mortality and incidence under several scenarios that represented a range of policies and programs designed to reduce the prevalence of under-nutrition, based on the experience and observed trends in similar countries. RESULTS: The modeled nutrition intervention scenarios brought about reductions in TB incidence and TB related mortality in the Central Eastern Indian states ranging from 43{\%} to 71{\%} and 40{\%} to 68{\%} respectively, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention. Modest reductions in under-nutrition averted 4.8 (95{\%} UR 0.5, 17.1) million TB cases and 1.6 (95{\%} UR 0.5, 5.2) million TB related deaths over a period of 20 years of intervention, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention. Complete elimination of under-nutrition in the Central Eastern states averted 9.4 (95{\%} UR 1.5, 30.6) million TB cases and 3.2 (95{\%} UR 0.7-, 10.1) million TB related deaths, relative to the scenario of no nutritional intervention. CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that intervening on under-nutrition could have a substantial impact on TB incidence and mortality in areas with high prevalence of under-nutrition, even if only small gains in under-nutrition can be achieved. Focusing on under-nutrition may be an effective way to reduce both rates of TB and other diseases associated with under-nutrition.},

abstract = {The decrease in overall incidence of TB in industrialised countries, together with the increasing concern for adverse events following BCG immunization, has led to important modifications of BCG policies in the last decades. This article adapts and validates - with surveillance data - a theoretical model estimating the impact of different national BCG vaccination policies on severe childhood TB in low to intermediate TB prevalent countries. The model shows that a universal BCG programme could be beneficial in settings with prevalence levels around 30 sputum smear positive per 100,000. In settings with prevalence levels below 15 per 100,000 the benefit of universal BCG vaccination should be carefully assessed, particularly where prevalence is below 5 per 100,000 and universal vaccination might lead to an excess of adverse events per case prevented. To this purpose the model also provides a tool to assess the theoretical impact of a policy change towards selective 'high-risk groups' vaccination. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {There is a critical need for improved and shorter tuberculosis (TB) treatment. Current in vitro models of TB, while valuable, are poor predictors of the antibacterial effect of drugs in vivo. Mathematical models may be useful to overcome the limitations of traditional approaches in TB research. The objective of this study was to set up a prototype mathematical model of TB treatment by rifampin, based on pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic and disease submodels. The full mathematical model can simulate the time-course of tuberculous disease from the first day of infection to the last day of therapy. Therapeutic simulations were performed with the full model to study the antibacterial effect of various dosage regimens of rifampin in lungs. The model reproduced some qualitative and quantitative properties of the bactericidal activity of rifampin observed in clinical data. The kill curves simulated with the model showed a typical biphasic decline in the number of extracellular bacteria consistent with observations in TB patients. Simulations performed with more simple pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic models indicated a possible role of a protected intracellular bacterial compartment in such a biphasic decline. This modeling effort strongly suggests that current dosage regimens of RIF may be further optimized. In addition, it suggests a new hypothesis for bacterial persistence during TB treatment.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: This study tested the hypothesis, first proposed by Chaussinand, that individual-level immunity acquired from exposure to tuberculosis may have contributed to the disappearance of leprosy from western Europe. METHODS: The epidemiological consequences of cross-immunity were assessed by the formulation of a mathematical model of the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis and leprosy. RESULTS: The conditions under which Mycobacterium tuberculosis could have eradicated Mycobacterium leprae were derived in terms of the basic reproductive rates of the two infections and the degree of cross-immunity. CONCLUSIONS: If the degree of cross-immunity between two diseases within an individual is known, then the epidemiological consequences of this cross-immunity can be assessed with transmission modeling. The results of this analysis, in combination with previous estimates of the basic reproductive rate of tuberculosis and degree of cross-immunity, imply that tuberculosis could have contributed to the decline of leprosy if the basic reproductive rate of leprosy was low.},

The model exhibits the traditional threshold behavior. We prove that when the basic reproductive number is less than unity, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable. When the basic reproductive number is greater than unity, the disease-free equilibrium is unstable and a unique endemic equilibrium exists which is locally asymptotically stable and globally asymptotically stable when the disease-induced death rate is equal to zero. The stability of disease-free equilibrium is derived by using Lyapunov stability theory and LaSalle's invariant set theorem. The global stability of endemic equilibrium is proved by generalized Dulac-Bendixson criterion when the disease-induced death rate is equal to zero.

This model was used for estimating future tuberculosis-prevented cases and costs for three treatment strategies--the 100{\%} standard course, the 100{\%} short course, and the existing strategy (a combination of 65{\%} standard course and 35{\%} short course)--in accordance with the master plan of the Indonesian Government's tuberculosis control programme. A cost-effectiveness analysis of the three strategies confirmed that the short-course strategy was the most cost-effective. Sensitivity analysis, which applied a broad range of parameters, continued to confirm the short-course strategy as the most cost-effective. If the short-course strategy had been applied in 1980 instead of the existing strategy (using the most likely parameters), the short-course strategy would prevent 1.8 million sputum-positive cases and would save 61.0 million dollars by the year 2000.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB), especially multidrug-resistant (MDR, resistance to rifampicin and isoniazid) disease, is associated with a worse patient outcome. Drug resistance diagnosed using microbiological culture takes days to weeks, as TB bacteria grow slowly. Rapid molecular tests for drug resistance detection (1 day) are commercially available and may promote faster initiation of appropriate treatment. OBJECTIVES: To (1) conduct a systematic review of evidence regarding diagnostic accuracy of molecular genetic tests for drug resistance, (2) conduct a health-economic evaluation of screening and diagnostic strategies, including comparison of alternative models of service provision and assessment of the value of targeting rapid testing at high-risk subgroups, and (3) construct a transmission-dynamic mathematical model that translates the estimates of diagnostic accuracy into estimates of clinical impact. REVIEW METHODS AND DATA SOURCES: A standardised search strategy identified relevant studies from EMBASE, PubMed, MEDLINE, Bioscience Information Service (BIOSIS), System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe Social Policy {\&} Practice (SIGLE) and Web of Science, published between 1 January 2000 and 15 August 2013. Additional 'grey' sources were included. Quality was assessed using quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies version 2 (QUADAS-2). For each diagnostic strategy and population subgroup, a care pathway was constructed to specify which medical treatments and health services that individuals would receive from presentation to the point where they either did or did not complete TB treatment successfully. A total cost was estimated from a health service perspective for each care pathway, and the health impact was estimated in terms of the mean discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) lost as a result of disease and treatment. Costs and QALYs were both discounted at 3.5{\%} per year. An integrated transmission-dynamic and economic model was used to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of introducing rapid molecular testing (in addition to culture and drug sensitivity testing). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to evaluate the impact on cost-effectiveness of diagnostic and treatment time delays, diagnosis and treatment costs, and associated QALYs. RESULTS: A total of 8922 titles and abstracts were identified, with 557 papers being potentially eligible. Of these, 56 studies contained sufficient test information for analysis. All three commercial tests performed well when detecting drug resistance in clinical samples, although with evidence of heterogeneity between studies. Pooled sensitivity for GenoType(R) MTBDRplus (Hain Lifescience, Nehren, Germany) (isoniazid and rifampicin resistance), INNO-LiPA Rif.TB(R) (Fujirebio Europe, Ghent, Belgium) (rifampicin resistance) and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF (Cepheid Inc., Sunnyvale, CA, USA) (rifampicin resistance) was 83.4{\%}, 94.6{\%}, 95.4{\%} and 96.8{\%}, respectively; equivalent pooled specificity was 99.6{\%}, 98.2{\%}, 99.7{\%} and 98.4{\%}, respectively. Results of the transmission model suggest that all of the rapid assays considered here, if added to the current diagnostic pathway, would be cost-saving and achieve a reduction in expected QALY loss compared with current practice. GenoType MTBDRplus appeared to be the most cost-effective of the rapid tests in the South Asian population, although results were similar for GeneXpert. In all other scenarios GeneXpert appeared to be the most cost-effective strategy. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid molecular tests for rifampicin and isoniazid resistance were sensitive and specific. They may also be cost-effective when added to culture drug susceptibility testing in the UK. There is global interest in point-of-care testing and further work is needed to review the performance of emerging tests and the wider health-economic impact of decentralised testing in clinics and primary care, as well as non-health-care settings, such as shelters and prisons.

abstract = {SETTING: England and Wales. OBJECTIVE: To quantify the relative contribution of vaccination, chemotherapy and preventive therapy to the reduction in tuberculosis incidence in England and Wales between 1953 and 1990. DESIGN: A compartmental model of tuberculosis transmission was fitted to notification data between 1913 and 1939 to estimate pre-vaccination parameters. Best-fit estimates of the rates of chemotherapy and preventive therapy were derived by fitting the model to notification data between 1953 and 1990. Published vaccination rates were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Number of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis averted. RESULTS: The numbers of respiratory tuberculosis cases averted between 1953 and 1990 by the use of preventive therapy, vaccination and chemotherapy were 288318, 57085 and 206996, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Of those interventions considered, preventive therapy has the greatest impact on transmission. The duration of infectiousness is long, with an onset that is likely to pre-date sputum positivity.},

abstract = {As novel diagnostics, therapies, and algorithms are developed to improve case finding, diagnosis, and clinical management of patients with TB, policymakers must make difficult decisions and choose among multiple new technologies while operating under heavy resource constrained settings. Mathematical modelling can provide helpful insight by describing the types of interventions likely to maximize impact on the population level and highlighting those gaps in our current knowledge that are most important for making such assessments. This review discusses the major contributions of TB transmission models in general, namely, the ability to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of TB. We focus particularly on those elements that are important to appropriately understand the role of TB diagnosis and treatment (i.e., what elements of better diagnosis or treatment are likely to have greatest population-level impact) and yet remain poorly understood at present. It is essential for modellers, decision-makers, and epidemiologists alike to recognize these outstanding gaps in knowledge and understand their potential influence on model projections that may guide critical policy choices (e.g., investment and scale-up decisions).},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine is given to Canadian Aboriginal neonates in selected communities. Severe reactions and deaths associated with BCG have been reported among infants born with immunodeficiency syndromes. The main objective of this study was to estimate threshold values for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) incidence, above which BCG is associated with greater risk than benefit. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural histories of tuberculosis (TB) and SCID in children from birth to 14 years. The annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARI) and SCID incidence were varied in analyses. The model compared a scenario of no vaccination to intervention with BCG. Appropriate variability and uncertainty analyses were conducted. Outcomes included TB incidence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: In sensitivity analyses, QALYs were lower among vaccinated infants if the ARI was 0.1{\%} and the rate of SCID was higher than 4.2 per 100,000. Assuming an ARI of 1{\%}, this threshold increased to 41 per 100,000. In uncertainty analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) which assumed an ARI of 0.1{\%}, QALYs were not significantly increased by BCG unless SCID incidence is 0. With this ARI, QALYs were significantly decreased among vaccinated children if SCID incidence exceeds 23 per 100,000. BCG is associated with a significant increase in QALYs if the ARI is 1{\%}, and SCID incidence is below 5 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: The possibility that Canadian Aboriginal children are at increased risk for SCID has serious implications for continued BCG use in this population. In this context, enhanced TB Control--including early detection and treatment of infection--may be a safer, more effective alternative.},

abstract = {Throughout the 1990s, there was an epidemic of multidrug resistant Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 in both animals and humans in Scotland. The use of antimicrobials in agriculture is often cited as a major source of antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria of humans, suggesting that DT104 in animals and humans should demonstrate similar prevalences of resistance determinants. Until very recently, only the application of molecular methods would allow such a comparison and our understanding has been hindered by the fact that surveillance data are primarily phenotypic in nature. Here, using large scale surveillance datasets and a novel Bayesian approach, we infer and compare the prevalence of Salmonella Genomic Island 1 (SGI1), SGI1 variants, and resistance determinants independent of SGI1 in animal and human DT104 isolates from such phenotypic data. We demonstrate differences in the prevalences of SGI1, SGI1-B, SGI1-C, absence of SGI1, and tetracycline resistance determinants independent of SGI1 between these human and animal populations, a finding that challenges established tenets that DT104 in domestic animals and humans are from the same well-mixed microbial population.},

abstract = {Pertussis is a highly infectious respiratory disease that has been on the rise in many countries worldwide over the past several years. The drivers of this increase in pertussis incidence remain hotly debated, with a central and long-standing hypothesis that questions the ability of vaccines to eliminate pertussis transmission rather than simply modulate the severity of disease. In this paper, we present age-structured case notification data from all provinces of Thailand between 1981 and 2014, a period during which vaccine uptake rose substantially, permitting an evaluation of the transmission impacts of vaccination. Our analyses demonstrate decreases in incidence across all ages with increased vaccine uptake - an observation that is at odds with pertussis case notification data in a number of other countries. To explore whether these observations are consistent with a rise in herd immunity and a reduction in bacterial transmission, we analyze an age-structured model that incorporates contrasting hypotheses concerning the immunological and transmission consequences of vaccines. Our results lead us to conclude that the most parsimonious explanation for the combined reduction in incidence and the shift to older age groups in the Thailand data is vaccine-induced herd immunity.},

abstract = {Natural infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, as well as cross-immune reactions with the constituent of standard vaccines, attenuated M. bovis, and other species of mycobacteria confer partial immunity to subsequent M. tuberculosis infection, It has been shown in the past that the immune response to mycobacteria found naturally in the environment reduces the benefit of vaccination as assessed by means of vaccine efficacy. In this paper we show that efficacy is a poor measure of the potential success of new anti-tuberculous vaccines due to its inability to account for the relative weight of reinfection in disease dynamics. We advocate instead the use of vaccine effectiveness when evaluating the impact of new control methods against infections that confer partial immunity. Through the study of a simple model that incorporates cross-reactive responses to environmental mycobacteria (EM) and reinfection, we show how the particulars of the relation between EM abundance and vaccine effectiveness depend on the degree of protection conferred respectively by natural infection, vaccination and EM. The relative importance of reinfection as a transmission mechanism comes Lip as the most important source of variability in vaccine effectiveness. Our results suggest that control efforts should be placed in reducing the importance of reinfection through diminishing transmission rates. Vaccines that overcome preexisting immunity to other mycobacteria will still have varying degrees of success depending on the underlying rate of TB transmission. (C) 2009 Elsevier Inc.

@article{Yaesoubi2013,
abstract = {The global tuberculosis (TB) control plan has historically emphasized passive case finding (PCF) as the most practical approach for identifying TB suspects in high burden settings. The success of this approach in controlling TB depends on infectious individuals recognizing their symptoms and voluntarily seeking diagnosis rapidly enough to reduce onward transmission. It now appears, at least in some settings, that more intensified case-finding (ICF) approaches may be needed to control TB transmission; these more aggressive approaches for detecting as-yet undiagnosed cases obviously require additional resources to implement. Given that TB control programs are resource constrained and that the incremental yield of ICF is expected to wane over time as the pool of undiagnosed cases is depleted, a tool that can help policymakers to identify when to implement or suspend an ICF intervention would be valuable. In this article, we propose dynamic case-finding policies that allow policymakers to use existing observations about the epidemic and resource availability to determine when to switch between PCF and ICF to efficiently use resources to optimize population health. Using mathematical models of TB/HIV coepidemics, we show that dynamic policies strictly dominate static policies that prespecify a frequency and duration of rounds of ICF. We also find that the use of a diagnostic tool with better sensitivity for detecting smear-negative cases (e.g., Xpert MTB/RIF) further improves the incremental benefit of these dynamic case-finding policies.},

Let alpha is an element of [0.78, 1.0] be the order of the fractional derivative, then the integer order model is obtained for alpha = 1.0. The model includes vertical transmission for HIV and treatment for both diseases. We compute the reproduction number of the integer order model and HIV and TB submodels, and the stability of the disease free equilibrium. We sketch the bifurcation diagrams of the integer order model, for variation of the average number of sexual partners per person and per unit time, and the tuberculosis transmission rate. We analyze numerical results of the fractional order model for different values of alpha, including alpha = 1. The results show distinct types of transients, for variation of alpha. Moreover, we speculate, from observation of the numerical results, that the order of the fractional derivative may behave as a bifurcation parameter for the model. We conclude that the dynamics of the integer and the fractional order versions of the model are very rich and that together these versions may provide a better understanding of the dynamics of HIV and TB coinfection.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE(S): Many countries are considering expanding HIV treatment following recent findings emphasizing the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on reducing HIV transmission in addition to already established survival benefits. Given the close interaction of tuberculosis (TB) and HIV epidemics, ART expansion could have important ramifications for TB burden. Previous studies suggest a wide range of possible TB impacts following ART expansion. We used three independently developed TB-HIV models to estimate the TB-related impact of expanding ART in South Africa. DESIGN: We considered two dimensions of ART expansion--improving coverage of pre-ART and ART services, and expanding CD4-based ART eligibility criteria (from CD4 {\textless}350 to CD4 {\textless}500 or all HIV-positive). METHODS: Three independent mathematical models were calibrated to the same data pertaining to the South African HIV-TB epidemic, and used to assess standardized ART policy changes. Key TB impact indicators were projected from 2014 to 2033. RESULTS: Compared with current eligibility and coverage, cumulative TB incidence was projected to decline by 6-30{\%} over the period 2014-2033 if ART eligibility were expanded to all HIV positive individuals, and by 28-37{\%} if effective ART coverage were additionally increased to 80{\%}. Overall, expanding ART was estimated to avert one TB case for each 10-13 additional person-years of ART. All models showed that TB incidence and mortality reductions would grow over time, but would stabilize towards the end of the projection period. CONCLUSION: ART expansion could substantially reduce TB incidence and mortality in South Africa and could provide a platform for collaborative HIV-TB programs to effectively halt HIV-associated TB.},

abstract = {Third-generation cephalosporin resistance of Salmonella and commensal Escherichia coli isolates from cattle in the United States is predominantly conferred by the cephamycinase CMY-2, which inactivates beta-lactam antimicrobial drugs used to treat a wide variety of infections, including pediatric salmonellosis. The emergence and dissemination of bla(CMY-2)(-)-bearing plasmids followed and may in part be the result of selection pressure imposed by the widespread utilization of ceftiofur, a third-generation veterinary cephalosporin. This study assessed the potential effects of ceftiofur on bla(CMY-2) transfer and dissemination by (i) an in vivo experimental study in which calves were inoculated with competent bla(CMY-2)-bearing plasmid donors and susceptible recipients and then subjected to ceftiofur selection and (ii) an observational study to determine whether ceftiofur use in dairy herds is associated with the occurrence and frequency of cephalosporin resistance in Salmonella and commensal E. coli. The first study revealed bla(CMY-2) plasmid transfer in both ceftiofur-treated and untreated calves but detected no enhancement of plasmid transfer associated with ceftiofur treatment. The second study detected no association (P = 0.22) between ceftiofur use and either the occurrence of ceftiofur-resistant salmonellosis or the frequency of cephalosporin resistance in commensal E. coli. However, herds with a history of salmonellosis (including both ceftiofur-resistant and ceftiofur-susceptible Salmonella isolates) used more ceftiofur than herds with no history of salmonellosis (P = 0.03) These findings fail to support a major role for ceftiofur use in the maintenance and dissemination of bla(CMY-2)-bearing plasmid mediated cephalosporin resistance in commensal E. coli and in pathogenic Salmonella in these dairy cattle populations.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis outbreaks originating in prisons, mines, or hospital wards can spread to the larger community. Recent proposals have targeted these high-transmission institutional amplifiers by improving case detection, treatment, or reducing the size of the exposed population. However, what effects these alternative proposals may have is unclear. We mathematically modeled these control strategies and found case detection and treatment methods insufficient in addressing epidemics involving common types of institutional amplifiers. Movement of persons in and out of amplifiers fundamentally altered the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis in a manner not effectively mitigated by detection or treatment alone. Policies increasing the population size exposed to amplifiers or the per-person duration of exposure within amplifiers potentially worsened incidence, even in settings with high rates of detection and treatment success. However, reducing the total population size entering institutional amplifiers significantly lowered tuberculosis incidence and the risk of propagating new drug-resistant tuberculosis strains.},

abstract = {This study sought to determine the impact of an effective programme of multidrug resistant tuberculosis control (MDRTB) on a population that is witnessing an explosive HIV epidemic among injecting drug users (IDUs), where the prevalence of MDRTB is already high. A transmission model was constructed that represents the dynamics of the drug-susceptible tuberculosis (DSTB), MDRTB and HIV spread among the adult population of Samara Oblast, Russia: from official notifications of tuberculosis and of HIV infection, estimates of MDRTB derived from surveillance studies, population data from official regional statistics, data on transmission probabilities from peer-reviewed publications and informed estimates, and policy-makers' estimates of IDU populations. Two scenarios of programme effectiveness for MDRTB were modelled and run over a period of 10 years to predict cumulative deaths. In a population of 3.3 million with a high prevalence of MDRTB, an emerging epidemic of HIV among IDUs, and a functioning directly observed therapy-short course (DOTS) programme, the model predicts that under low cure rates for MDRTB the expected cumulative deaths from tuberculosis will reach 6303 deaths including 1900 deaths from MDRTB at 10 years. Under high cure rate for MDRTB 4465 deaths will occur including 134 deaths from MDRTB. At 10 years there is little impact on HIV-infected populations from the MDRTB epidemic, but as the HIV epidemic matures the impact becomes substantial. When the model is extended to 20 years cumulative deaths from MDRTB become very high if cure rates for MDRTB are low and cumulative deaths in the HIV-infected population, likewise, are profoundly affected. In the presence of an immature HIV epidemic failure to actively control MDRTB may result in approximately a third more deaths than if effective treatment is given. As the HIV epidemic matures then the impact of MDRTB grows substantially if MDRTB control strategies are ineffective. The epidemiological starting point for these scenarios is present in many regions within the former Soviet Union and this analysis suggests control of MDRTB should be an urgent priority.},

abstract = {Two tuberculosis (TB) models with treatment and self-cure are investigated. It is assumed that the treated individuals may reenter either the latent compartment due to the remainder of Mycobacterium tuberculosis or the infectious compartment due to the treatment failure. On the other hand, infectious individuals with mild symptoms may reenter the latent compartment due to self-cure. After investigating a simple model with one latent compartment, a TB model with two latent compartments is studied to describe the slow and fast progression of the exposed individuals. The basic reproduction numbers of those two models are defined, and their epidemiological interpretation is given. Similar threshold dynamics is obtained for those two models: the disease dies out ultimately when the basic reproduction number is less than or equal to one; the unique endemic equilibrium is globally stable when the basic reproduction number is greater than one. The influence of treatment failure and self-cure on the basic reproduction number is also discussed.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Despite the close link between tuberculosis (TB) and poverty, most mathematical models of TB have not addressed underlying social and structural determinants. OBJECTIVE: To review studies employing mathematical modelling to evaluate the epidemiological impact of the structural determinants of TB. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed and personal libraries to identify eligible articles. We extracted data on the modelling techniques employed, research question, types of structural determinants modelled and setting. RESULTS: From 232 records identified, we included eight articles published between 2008 and 2015; six employed population-based dynamic TB transmission models and two non-dynamic analytic models. Seven studies focused on proximal TB determinants (four on nutritional status, one on wealth, one on indoor air pollution, and one examined overcrowding, socio-economic and nutritional status), and one focused on macro-economic influences. CONCLUSIONS: Few modelling studies have attempted to evaluate structural determinants of TB, resulting in key knowledge gaps. Despite the challenges of modelling such a complex system, models must broaden their scope to remain useful for policy making. Given the intersectoral nature of the interrelations between structural determinants and TB outcomes, this work will require multidisciplinary collaborations. A useful starting point would be to focus on developing relatively simple models that can strengthen our knowledge regarding the potential effect of the structural determinants on TB outcomes.},

@article{Magombedze2011,
abstract = {The majority of individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) bacilli develop latent infection. Mtb becomes dormant and phenotypically drug resistant when it encounters multiple stresses within the host, and expresses a set of genes, known as the dormancy regulon, in vivo. These genes are expressed in vitro in response to nitric oxide (NO), hypoxia (oxygen deprivation), and nutrient starvation. The occurrence and reactivation of latent tuberculosis (TB) is not clearly understood. The ability of the pathogen to enter and exit from different states is associated with its ability to cause persistent infection. During infection it is not known whether the organism is in a persistent slow replicating state or a dormant non-replicating state, with the latter ultimately causing a latent infection with the potential to reactivate to active disease. We collected gene expression data for Mtb bacilli under different stress conditions that simulate latency or dormancy. Time course experiments were selected and differentially expressed gene profiles were determined at each time point. A mathematical model was then developed to show the dynamics of Mtb latency based on the profile of differentially expressed genes. Analysis of the time course data show the dynamics of latency occurrence in vitro and the mathematical model reveals all possible scenarios of Mtb latency development with respect to the different conditions that may be produced by the immune response in vivo. The mathematical model provides a biological explanation of how Mtb latency occurs based on observed gene expression changes in in vitro latency models.},

Containment of the infection or progression of disease depends on the behavior of individual cells, which, in turn, depends on the local molecular environment and on contact with neighboring cells. Modeling can help us understand the nonlinear interactions that drive the overall dynamics in this system. Early events in infection are particularly important, as are spatial effects and inherently stochastic processes. We describe a model of early Mycobacterium infection using the CyCells simulator, which was designed to capture these effects.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Because delay in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) contributes to the spread of disease and the associated mortality risk, the authors examined the effectiveness and cost of recent advances in methods of diagnosing TB and testing for drug susceptibility, comparing these rapid methods to traditional approaches. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to compare newer rapid and older nonrapid methods for diagnosing TB and testing for drug susceptibility. The average time to diagnosis, average time to treatment, average mortality, and cost of caring for patients evaluated for TB were compared. RESULTS: Using a combination of solid medium and broth cultures, nucleic acid probes for identification, and radiometric broth drug susceptibility testing would lead to diagnosis on average 15 days faster and to appropriate therapy on average five days sooner than methods currently employed by many U.S. laboratories. The average mortality would drop by five patients per 1000 patients evaluated (31{\%}) and the average cost per patient would drop by {\$}272 (18{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: In this era of cost containment, it is important to incorporate test sensitivity and specificity when evaluating technologies. Tests with higher unit costs may lead to lower medical expenditures when diagnostic accuracy and speed are improved. U.S. laboratories should employ available rapid techniques for the diagnosis of TB.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death among individuals infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The study of the joint dynamics of HIV and TB present formidable mathematical challenges due to the fact that the models of transmission are quite distinct. Furthermore, although there is overlap in the populations at risk of HIV and TB infections, the magnitude of the proportion of individuals at risk for both diseases is not known. Here, we consider a highly simplified deterministic model that incorporates the joint dynamics of TB and HIV, a model that is quite hard to analyze. We compute independent reproductive numbers for TB (R1) and HIV (R2) and the overall reproductive number for the system, R=max{\{}R1, R2{\}}. The focus is naturally (given the highly simplified nature of the framework) on the qualitative analysis of this model. We find that if R {\textless} 1 then the disease-free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable. The TB-only equilibrium ET is locally asymptotically stable if R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textless} 1. However, the symmetric condition, R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1, does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the HIV-only equilibrium EH, and it is possible that TB can coexist with HIV when R2 {\textgreater} 1. In other words, in the case when R1 {\textless} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1 (or when R1 {\textgreater} 1 and R2 {\textgreater} 1), we are able to find a stable HIV/TB coexistence equilibrium. Moreover, we show that the prevalence level of TB increases with R2 {\textgreater} 1 under certain conditions. Through simulations, we find that i) the increased progression rate from latent to active TB in co-infected individuals may play a significant role in the rising prevalence of TB; and ii) the increased progression rates from HIV to AIDS have not only increased the prevalence level of HIV while decreasing TB prevalence, but also generated damped oscillations in the system.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The HIV epidemic has caused a dramatic increase in tuberculosis (TB) in East and southern Africa. Several strategies have the potential to reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, and cost and cost-effectiveness analyses can help to prioritize them when budget constraints exist. However, published cost and cost-effectiveness studies are limited. METHODS: Our objective was to compare the cost, affordability and cost-effectiveness of seven strategies for reducing the burden of TB in countries with high HIV prevalence. A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV and recent cost data were used to assess the costs (year 2003 USD prices) and effects (TB cases averted, deaths averted, DALYs gained) of these strategies in Kenya during the period 2004-2023. RESULTS: The three lowest cost and most cost-effective strategies were improving TB cure rates, improving TB case detection rates, and improving both together. The incremental cost of combined improvements to case detection and cure was below USD 15 million per year (7.5{\%} of year 2000 government health expenditure); the mean cost per DALY gained of these three strategies ranged from USD 18 to USD 34. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) had the highest incremental costs, which by 2007 could be as large as total government health expenditures in year 2000. ART could also gain more DALYs than the other strategies, at a cost per DALY gained of around USD 260 to USD 530. Both the costs and effects of treatment for latent tuberculosis infection (TLTI) for HIV+ individuals were low; the cost per DALY gained ranged from about USD 85 to USD 370. Averting one HIV infection for less than USD 250 would be as cost-effective as improving TB case detection and cure rates to WHO target levels. CONCLUSION: To reduce the burden of TB in high HIV prevalence settings, the immediate goal should be to increase TB case detection rates and, to the extent possible, improve TB cure rates, preferably in combination. Realising the full potential of ART will require substantial new funding and strengthening of health system capacity so that increased funding can be used effectively.},

abstract = {Studies of early bactericidal activity (EBA) are important in the rapid evaluation of new antituberculosis drugs. Historically, these have concentrated on the log fall in the viable count in sputum during the first 48 hours of therapy. In this paper, we provide a mathematical model that suggests that the viable count in sputum follows an exponential decay curve with the equation V = S + Me(-kt) (where V is the viable count, M the population of bacteria susceptible to the test drug, S the population susceptible only to sterilizing agents, t the day of sputum collection as related to start of therapy, k the rate constant for the bacteria killed each day, and e the Napierian constant). We demonstrate that data from clinical trials fits the exponential decay model. We propose that future EBA studies should be performed by measuring daily quantitative counts for at least 5 days. We also propose that the comparison of the early bactericidal activity of antituberculosis drugs should be evaluated using the time taken to reduce the viable count by 50{\%} (vt(50)). A further reiterative refinement following a rule set based on statistically the best fit to the exponential decay model is described that will allow investigators to identify anomalous results and thus enhance the accuracy in measuring early bactericidal activity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Observational studies have suggested that BCG may have nonspecific beneficial effects on survival. Low-birth-weight (LBW) children are not given BCG at birth in Guinea-Bissau; we conducted a randomized trial of BCG at birth (early BCG) vs delayed BCG. METHODS In the period 2004-2008 we recruited 2320 LBW children in Bissau. The children were visited at home at 2, 6, and 12 months of age. With a pretrial infant mortality of 250 per 1000, we hypothesized a 25{\%} reduction in infant mortality for LBW children. RESULTS Infant mortality was only 101 per 1000 during the trial. In the primary analysis, infant mortality was reduced insignificantly by 17{\%} (mortality rate ratio [MRR] = .83 [.63-1.08]). In secondary analyses, early BCG vaccine was safe with an MRR of .49 (.21-1.15) after 3 days and .55 (.34-.89) after 4 weeks. The reduction in neonatal mortality was mainly due to fewer cases of neonatal sepsis, respiratory infection, and fever. The impact of early BCG on infant mortality was marked for children weighing {\textless}1.5 kg (MRR = .43 [.21-.85]) who had lower coverage for diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis vaccinations. CONCLUSIONS Though early BCG did not reduce infant mortality significantly, it may have a beneficial effect in the neonatal period. This could be important for public health because BCG is often delayed in low-income countries.},

abstract = {Infection of humans with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) results in diverse outcomes that range from acute disease to establishment of persistence and to even clearance of the pathogen. These different outcomes represent the combined result of host heterogeneity on the one hand, and virulence properties of the infecting strain of pathogen on the other. From the standpoint of the host, the balance between PGE2, LXA4 and LTB4 represents at least one of the factors that dictates the eventual pathophysiology. We therefore built an ODE model to describe the host-pathogen interaction and studied the local stability properties of the system, to obtain the parametric conditions that lead to different disease outcomes. We then modulated levels of the pro- and anti-inflammatory lipid mediators to better understand the convergence between host phenotype and factors that relate to virulence properties of the pathogen. Global sensitivity analysis, using the variance-based method of extended Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test (eFAST), revealed that disease severity was indeed defined by combined effects of phenotypic variability at the level of both host and pathogen. Interestingly here, [PGE2] was found to act as a switch between bacterial clearance and acute disease. Our mathematical model suggests that development of more effective treatments for tuberculosis will be contingent upon a better understanding of how the intrinsic variability at the level of both host and pathogen contribute to influence the nature of interactions between these two entities.},

abstract = {Over the past decade, numerous studies have identified tuberculosis patients in whom more than one distinct strain of Mycobacterium tuberculosis is present. While it has been shown that these mixed strain infections can reduce the probability of treatment success for individuals simultaneously harboring both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains, it is not yet known if and how this phenomenon impacts the long-term dynamics for tuberculosis within communities. Strain-specific differences in immunogenicity and associations with drug resistance suggest that a better understanding of how strains compete within hosts will be necessary to project the effects of mixed strain infections on the future burden of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant tuberculosis. In this paper, we develop a modeling framework that allows us to investigate mechanisms of strain competition within hosts and to assess the long-term effects of such competition on the ecology of strains in a population. These models permit us to systematically evaluate the importance of unknown parameters and to suggest priority areas for future experimental research. Despite the current scarcity of data to inform the values of several model parameters, we are able to draw important qualitative conclusions from this work. We find that mixed strain infections may promote the coexistence of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains in two ways. First, mixed strain infections allow a strain with a lower basic reproductive number to persist in a population where it would otherwise be outcompeted if has competitive advantages within a co-infected host. Second, some individuals progressing to phenotypically drug-sensitive tuberculosis from a state of mixed drug-sensitive and drug-resistant infection may retain small subpopulations of drug-resistant bacteria that can flourish once the host is treated with antibiotics. We propose that these types of mixed infections, by increasing the ability of low fitness drug-resistant strains to persist, may provide opportunities for compensatory mutations to accumulate and for relatively fit, highly drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis to emerge.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is a pulmonary pathogen of major global concern. A key feature of Mtb infection in primates is the formation of granulomas, dense cellular structures surrounding infected lung tissue. These structures serve as the main site of host-pathogen interaction in TB, and thus to effectively treat TB we must clarify mechanisms of granuloma formation and their function in disease. Fibrotic granulomas are associated with both good and bad disease outcomes. Fibrosis can serve to isolate infected tissue from healthy tissue, but it can also cause difficulty breathing as it leaves scars. Little is known about fibrosis in TB, and data from non-human primates is just beginning to clarify the picture. This work focuses on constructing a hybrid multi-scale model of fibrotic granuloma formation, in order to identify mechanisms driving development of fibrosis in Mtb infected lungs. We combine dynamics of molecular, cellular, and tissue scale models from previously published studies to characterize the formation of two common sub-types of fibrotic granulomas: peripherally fibrotic, with a cuff of collagen surrounding granulomas, and centrally fibrotic, with collagen throughout granulomas. Uncertainty and sensitivity analysis, along with large simulation sets, enable us to identify mechanisms differentiating centrally versus peripherally fibrotic granulomas. These findings suggest that heterogeneous cytokine environments exist within granulomas and may be responsible for driving tissue scale morphologies. Using this model we are primed to better understand the complex structure of granulomas, a necessity for developing successful treatments for TB.},

abstract = {The importance of high-incidence "hotspots" to population-level tuberculosis (TB) incidence remains poorly understood. TB incidence varies widely across countries, but within smaller geographic areas (e.g., cities), TB transmission may be more homogeneous than other infectious diseases. We constructed a steady-state compartmental model of TB in Rio de Janeiro, replicating nine epidemiological variables (e.g., TB incidence) within 1{\%} of their observed values. We estimated the proportion of TB transmission originating from a high-incidence hotspot (6.0{\%} of the city's population, 16.5{\%} of TB incidence) and the relative impact of TB control measures targeting the hotspot vs. the general community. If each case of active TB in the hotspot caused 0.5 secondary transmissions in the general community for each within-hotspot transmission, the 6.0{\%} of people living in the hotspot accounted for 35.3{\%} of city-wide TB transmission. Reducing the TB transmission rate (i.e., number of secondary infections per infectious case) in the hotspot to that in the general community reduced city-wide TB incidence by 9.8{\%} in year 5, and 29.7{\%} in year 50-an effect similar to halving time to diagnosis for the remaining 94{\%} of the community. The importance of the hotspot to city-wide TB control depended strongly on the extent of TB transmission from the hotspot to the general community. High-incidence hotspots may play an important role in propagating TB epidemics. Achieving TB control targets in a hotspot containing 6{\%} of a city's population can have similar impact on city-wide TB incidence as achieving the same targets throughout the remaining community.},

abstract = {The study of biological systems commonly depends on inferring the state of a 'hidden' variable, such as an underlying genotype, from that of an 'observed' variable, such as an expressed phenotype. However, this cannot be achieved using traditional quantitative methods when more than one genetic mechanism exists for a single observable phenotype. Using a novel latent class Bayesian model, it is possible to infer the prevalence of different genetic elements in a population given a sample of phenotypes. As an exemplar, data comprising phenotypic resistance to six antimicrobials obtained from passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 are analysed to infer the prevalence of individual resistance genes, as well as the prevalence of a genomic island known as SGI1 and its variants. Three competing models are fitted to the data and distinguished between using posterior predictive p-values to assess their ability to predict the observed number of unique phenotypes. The results suggest that several SGI1 variants circulate in a few fixed forms through the population from which our data were derived. The methods presented could be applied to other types of phenotypic data, and represent a useful and generic mechanism of inferring the genetic population structure of organisms.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: There is substantial state-to-state heterogeneity in tuberculosis (TB) in the United States; better understanding this heterogeneity can inform effective response to TB at the state level, the level at which most TB control efforts are coordinated. OBJECTIVES: To characterize drivers of state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four U.S. states that bear half the country's TB burden: California, Florida, New York, and Texas. METHODS: We constructed an individual-based model of TB in the four U.S. states and calibrated the model to state-specific demographic and age- and nativity-stratified TB incidence data. We used the model to infer differences in natural history of TB and in future projections of TB. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We found that differences in both demographic makeup (particularly the size and composition of the foreign-born population) and TB transmission dynamics contribute to state-level differences in TB epidemiology. The projected median annual rate of decline in TB incidence in the next decade was substantially higher in Texas (3.3{\%}; 95{\%} range, -5.6 to 10.9) than in California (1.7{\%}; 95{\%} range, -3.8 to 7.1), Florida (1.5{\%}; 95{\%} range, -7.4 to 14), and New York (1.9{\%}; 95{\%} range, -6.4 to 9.8). All scenarios projected a flattening of the decline in TB incidence by 2025 without additional resources or interventions. CONCLUSIONS: There is substantial state-level heterogeneity in TB epidemiology in the four states, which reflect both demographic factors and potential differences in the natural history of TB. These differences may inform resource allocation decisions in these states.},

abstract = {The lognormal distribution typically is used to model variability in respiratory penetration values. The lognormal model is a good descriptor where the average penetration value is low, but may be a poor descriptor where the average penetration value is high because a significant fraction of penetration values could be predicted to exceed unity. In this regard, the beta distribution offers greater flexibility than the lognormal in modeling penetration values over the physically plausible interval [0,1]. The beta distribution also is shown to be mathematically convenient for describing the risk of airborne transmission of tuberculosis among a respirator-wearing population. Infection can occur following inhalation of respirable particles, termed droplet nuclei, carrying viable Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli. Based on the expected number of infectious doses inhaled, the Poisson probability model traditionally is used to predict an individual's risk of infection. This article synthesizes the beta distribution, as applied to average penetration values among a respirator-wearing population, and the Poisson distribution, as applied to an individual's infection risk, to describe the population risk of M. tuberculosis infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently represents the closest "gold standard" for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but operational data are scant on the impact and cost-effectiveness of TB culture for human immunodeficiency (HIV-) infected individuals in resource-limited settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded costs, laboratory results, and dates of initiating TB therapy in a centralized TB culture program for HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, constructing a decision-analysis model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TB culture from the perspective of a public-sector TB control program. Of 217 TB suspects presenting between January 2006 and March 2008, 33 (15{\%}) had culture-confirmed active tuberculosis; 23 (70{\%}) were smear-negative. Among smear-negative, culture-positive patients, 6 (26{\%}) began TB therapy before culture results were available, 11 (48{\%}) began TB therapy after culture result availability, and 6 (26{\%}) did not begin TB therapy within 180 days of presentation. The cost per negative culture was US{\$}17.52 (solid media)-{\$}23.50 (liquid media). Per 1,000 TB suspects and compared with smear alone, TB culture with solid media would avert an estimated eight TB deaths (95{\%} simulation interval [SI]: 4, 15) and 37 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95{\%} SI: 13, 76), at a cost of {\$}36 (95{\%} SI: {\$}25, {\$}50) per TB suspect or {\$}962 (95{\%} SI: {\$}469, {\$}2642) per DALY averted. Replacing solid media with automated liquid culture would avert one further death (95{\%} SI: -1, 4) and eight DALYs (95{\%} SI: -4, 23) at {\$}2751 per DALY (95{\%} SI: {\$}680, dominated). The cost-effectiveness of TB culture was more sensitive to characteristics of the existing TB diagnostic system than to the accuracy or cost of TB culture. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: TB culture is potentially effective and cost-effective for HIV-positive patients in resource-constrained settings. Reliable transmission of culture results to patients and integration with existing systems are essential.},

abstract = {Approximately 100 million newborn children receive Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) annually, because vaccination is consistently protective against childhood tuberculous meningitis and miliary TB. By contrast, BCG efficacy against pulmonary TB in children and adults is highly variable, ranging from 0{\%} to 80{\%}, though it tends to be higher in individuals who have no detectable prior exposure to mycobacterial infections, as judged by the absence of delayed-type hypersensitivity response (a negative tuberculin skin test, TST). The duration of protection against pulmonary TB is also variable, but lasts about 10 years on average. These observations raise the possibility that BCG revaccination, following primary vaccination in infancy, could be efficacious among TST-negative adolescents as they move into adulthood, the period of highest risk for pulmonary disease. To inform continuing debate about revaccination, this paper assesses the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of revaccinating adolescents in a setting with intense transmission-Cape Town, South Africa. For a cost of revaccination in the range US{\$}1-10 per person, and vaccine efficacy between 10{\%} and 80{\%} with protection for 10 years, the incremental cost per year of healthy life recovered (disability-adjusted life years, DALY) in the vaccinated population lies between US{\$}116 and US{\$}9237. The intervention is about twice as cost-effective when allowing for the extra benefits of preventing transmission, with costs per DALY recovered in the range US{\$}52-{\$}4540. At 80{\%} efficacy, revaccination averted 17{\%} of cases. Under the scenarios investigated, BCG revaccination is cost-effective against international benchmarks, though not highly effective. Cost-effectiveness ratios would be more favourable if we also allow for TB cases averted by preventing transmission to HIV-positive people, for the protection of HIV-negative people who later acquire HIV infection, for the possible non-specific benefits of BCG, for the fact that some adolescents would receive BCG for the first time, and for cost sharing when BCG is integrated into an adolescent immunization programme. These findings suggest, subject to further evaluation, that BCG revaccination could be cost-effective in some settings.},

A convenience sample of 309 drug-susceptible and 342 multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB isolates, collected July 2008-July 2009, were characterized by spoligotyping, DNA fingerprinting, insertion site mapping, and targeted DNA sequencing. Analysis of molecular-based data showed diverse genetic backgrounds among drug-sensitive and MDR TB sensu stricto isolates in contrast to restricted genetic backgrounds among pre-extensively drug-resistant (pre-XDR) TB and XDR TB isolates. Second-line drug resistance was significantly associated with the atypical Beijing genotype. DNA fingerprinting and sequencing demonstrated that the pre-XDR and XDR atypical Beijing isolates evolved from a common progenitor; 85{\%} and 92{\%}, respectively, were clustered, indicating transmission. Ninety-three percent of atypical XDR Beijing isolates had mutations that confer resistance to 10 anti-TB drugs, and some isolates also were resistant to para-aminosalicylic acid. These findings suggest the emergence of totally drug-resistant TB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to compare the cost effectiveness of the current Irish programme of universal BCG vaccination of infants versus a programme which considered selectively vaccinating high risk infants using decision analytical modelling. METHODS: The efficacy of the BCG vaccine was re-evaluated to inform a decision analytical model constructed to follow a birth cohort of vaccinated and unvaccinated infants over a 15 year time horizon. The number of life years gained (LYG) was the primary outcome measure and this was compared to the net cost of the vaccination strategies. RESULTS: In the base case analysis, the incremental cost effectiveness ratios (ICERs) for the universal strategy and selective strategy vs no vaccination were euro204,373/LYG and euro143,233/LYG respectively. When comparing the incremental difference in moving from the universal to the selective strategy, the selective strategy costs euro1,055,692 less per 4.8 life years lost per birth cohort. One way sensitivity analyses highlighted that a move from the universal to the selective strategy was particularly sensitive to the estimate of vaccine efficacy against deaths, the cost of administering the vaccine and the multiplier used to apportion risk of contracting tuberculosis. Probabilistic analysis suggested that a move from a universal based strategy to a selective based strategy could be deemed cost effective (probability of cost effectiveness is 76.8 {\%}). CONCLUSION: The results of the study support the protective effect of the BCG vaccine in infants and quantified the cost effectiveness of the current BCG vaccination strategy and the decremental difference in moving to a selective strategy. This analysis highlights that the additional protection offered by the universal vaccination strategy is small compared to that of the selective strategy. Consideration should therefore be given to the implementation of a selective vaccination strategy, and diverting resources to improve TB case management and control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) case notification rates are usually higher in men than in women, but notification data are insufficient to measure sex differences in disease burden. This review set out to systematically investigate whether sex ratios in case notifications reflect differences in disease prevalence and to identify gaps in access to and/or utilisation of diagnostic services. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In accordance with the published protocol (CRD42015022163), TB prevalence surveys in nationally representative and sub-national adult populations (age {\textgreater}/= 15 y) in low- and middle-income countries published between 1 January 1993 and 15 March 2016 were identified through searches of PubMed, Embase, Global Health, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews; review of abstracts; and correspondence with the World Health Organization. Random-effects meta-analyses examined male-to-female (M:F) ratios in TB prevalence and prevalence-to-notification (P:N) ratios for smear-positive TB. Meta-regression was done to identify factors associated with higher M:F ratios in prevalence and higher P:N ratios. Eighty-three publications describing 88 surveys with over 3.1 million participants in 28 countries were identified (36 surveys in Africa, three in the Americas, four in the Eastern Mediterranean, 28 in South-East Asia and 17 in the Western Pacific). Fifty-six surveys reported in 53 publications were included in quantitative analyses. Overall random-effects weighted M:F prevalence ratios were 2.21 (95{\%} CI 1.92-2.54; 56 surveys) for bacteriologically positive TB and 2.51 (95{\%} CI 2.07-3.04; 40 surveys) for smear-positive TB. M:F prevalence ratios were highest in South-East Asia and in surveys that did not require self-report of signs/symptoms in initial screening procedures. The summary random-effects weighted M:F ratio for P:N ratios was 1.55 (95{\%} CI 1.25-1.91; 34 surveys). We intended to stratify the analyses by age, HIV status, and rural or urban setting; however, few studies reported such data. CONCLUSIONS: TB prevalence is significantly higher among men than women in low- and middle-income countries, with strong evidence that men are disadvantaged in seeking and/or accessing TB care in many settings. Global strategies and national TB programmes should recognise men as an underserved high-risk group and improve men's access to diagnostic and screening services to reduce the overall burden of TB more effectively and ensure gender equity in TB care.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: After steady decline since the 1990s, tuberculosis (TB) incidence in New York City (NYC) and the United States (US) has flattened. The reasons for this trend and the implications for the future trajectory of TB in the US remain unclear. METHODS: We developed a compartmental model of TB in NYC, parameterized with detailed epidemiological data. We ran the model under five alternative scenarios representing different explanations for recent declines in TB incidence. We evaluated each scenario's relative likelihood by comparing its output to available data. We used the most likely scenarios to explore drivers of TB incidence and predict future trajectories of the TB epidemic in NYC. FINDINGS: Demographic changes and declining TB transmission alone were insufficient to explain recent trends in NYC TB incidence. Only scenarios that assumed contemporary changes in TB dynamics among the foreign-born - a declining rate of reactivation or a decrease in imported subclinical TB - could accurately describe the trajectory of TB incidence since 2007. In those scenarios, the projected decline in TB incidence from 2015 to 2025 varied from minimal [2.0{\%}/year (95{\%} credible interval 0.4-3.5{\%})] to similar to 2005 to 2009 trends [4.4{\%}/year (2.5-6.4{\%})]. The primary factor differentiating optimistic from pessimistic projections was the degree to which improvements in TB dynamics among the foreign-born continued into the coming decade. INTERPRETATION: Further progress against TB in NYC requires additional focus on the foreign-born population. Absent additional intervention in this group, TB incidence may not decline further.},

abstract = {To establish itself within the host system, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) has formulated various means of attacking the host system. One such crucial strategy is the exploitation of the iron resources of the host system. Obtaining and maintaining the required concentration of iron becomes a matter of contest between the host and the pathogen, both trying to achieve this through complex molecular networks. The extent of complexity makes it important to obtain a systems perspective of the interplay between the host and the pathogen with respect to iron homeostasis. We have reconstructed a systems model comprising 92 components and 85 protein-protein or protein-metabolite interactions, which have been captured as a set of 194 rules. Apart from the interactions, these rules also account for protein synthesis and decay, RBC circulation and bacterial production and death rates. We have used a rule-based modelling approach, Kappa, to simulate the system separately under infection and non-infection conditions. Various perturbations including knock-outs and dual perturbation were also carried out to monitor the behavioral change of important proteins and metabolites. From this, key components as well as the required controlling factors in the model that are critical for maintaining iron homeostasis were identified. The model is able to re-establish the importance of iron-dependent regulator (ideR) in Mtb and transferrin (Tf) in the host. Perturbations, where iron storage is increased, appear to enhance nutritional immunity and the analysis indicates how they can be harmful for the host. Instead, decreasing the rate of iron uptake by Tf may prove to be helpful. Simulation and perturbation studies help in identifying Tf as a possible drug target. Regulating the mycobactin (myB) concentration was also identified as a possible strategy to control bacterial growth. The simulations thus provide significant insight into iron homeostasis and also for identifying possible drug targets for tuberculosis.},

METHODS: A Markov state-transition decision analytic model using the societal perspective and lifetime horizon was constructed to compare costs and quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) associated with the 3 strategies for hypothetical 35-year-old HCWs with or without prior BCG vaccination. Direct and indirect costs and probabilities were based on manufacturer data, national Veterans Health Administration records, and the published literature. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3{\%} per year. RESULTS: Both IGRAs were more effective and less costly than the TST, whether or not the HCW had been vaccinated with BCG previously. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-G compared with the QFT-GIT was {\$}14,092/QALY for non-BCG-vaccinated HCWs and {\$}103,047/QALY for BCG-vaccinated HCWs. There was no prevalence of LTBI at which the TST became the most effective or least costly strategy. If the sensitivity of the QFT-GIT exceeds that of the QFT-G, then the QFT-GIT is the most effective and least costly strategy. CONCLUSION: Use of the QFT-G and QFT-GIT leads to superior clinical outcomes and lower costs than the TST and should be considered in screening non-BCG-vaccinated and BCG-vaccinated new HCWs for LTBI.},

abstract = {Incidence and mortality due to tuberculosis (TB) have been decreasing worldwide. Given that TB is a cosmopolitan disease, proper surveillance and evaluation are critical for controlling dissemination. Herein, mathematical modeling was performed in order to: 1) demonstrate a correlation between the incidence of TB in HIV-free patients in the US and Germany, and their corresponding mortality rates; 2) show the utility of the newly developed D-R algorithm for analyzing and predicting the incidence of TB in both countries; and 3) inform us on population death rates due to TB in HIV-negative patients. Using data published by the World Health Organization between 1990 and 2009, the relationship between incidence and mortality that could not be ascribed to HIV infection was evaluated. Using linear, quadratic and cubic curves, we found that a cubic function provided the best fit with the data in both the US (Y = 2.3588+2.2459X+61.1639X(2)-60.104X(3)) and Germany (Y = 1.9271+9.4967X+18.3824X(2)-10.350X(3)) where the correlation coefficient (R) between incidence and mortality was 0.995 and 0.993, respectively. Second, we demonstrated that fitted curves using the D-R model were equal to or better than those generated using the GM(1,1) algorithm as exemplified in the relative values for Sum of Squares of Error, Relative Standard Error, Mean Absolute Deviation, Average Relative Error, and Mean Absolute Percentage Error. Finally, future trends using both the D-R and the classic GM(1,1) models predicted a continued decline in infection and mortality rates of TB in HIV-negative patients rates extending to 2015 assuming no changes to diagnosis or treatment regimens are enacted.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a potentially fatal disease spread by an airborne pathogen infecting approximately one third of the globe. For decades, contact tracing (CT) has served a key role in the control of TB and many other notifiable communicable diseases. Unfortunately, CT is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process and is often conducted by a small and overworked nursing staff. To help improve the effectiveness of CT, we introduce a detailed, individual-based model of CT for the Canadian province of Saskatchewan. The model captures the detailed operation of TB CT, including loss to follow-up, and prophylactic and case treatment. This representation is used to assess the impact on active TB cases and TB infection prevalence of differential scoping, speed, prioritization of the CT process, and reduced loss to follow-up. Scenario results are broadly consistent with--but provide many additional insights beyond--our previously reported findings using an aggregate model. In the context of a stylized northern community, findings suggest that age- and ethnicity-prioritized schemes could improve CT effectiveness compared to unprioritized schemes by dramatically reducing TB infection and preventing on average roughly 11{\%} (p {\textless} .0001) of active TB cases over a period of 20 years. Reducing loss to follow-up to 10{\%} could yield 5.4{\%} (p = .02) TB cases prevented on average with lower prevalence of TB infection, but improving the CT speed does not yield significant improvement in TB outcomes. Finally, although the work emphasized the value of social network analysis, we found that caution should be exercised in directly translating social network analysis-observed associations into prioritization recommendations.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare tuberculin screening of all kindergartners and high school entrants (screen-all strategy) vs screening limited to high-risk children (targeted screening). DESIGN: Decision, cost-effectiveness, and cost-benefit analyses. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Students in a large urban and rural county. DEFINITIONS: High risk of tuberculosis infection was defined as birth in a county with a high prevalence of tuberculosis. Low risk was defined as birth in the United States. OUTCOME MEASURES: Tuberculosis cases prevented for 10, 000 children screened. Net costs, net cost per case prevented, benefit-cost ratio, and incremental cost-effectiveness. RESULTS: The screen-all strategy would prevent 14.9 cases per 10,000 children screened; targeted screening would prevent 84.9 cases per 10,000 children screened. The screen-all strategy is more costly than no screening; the benefit-cost ratio is 0.58. Targeted screening would result in a net savings; the benefit-cost ratio is 1.2. Screening all children is cost saving only if the reactor rate is 20{\%} or greater. The cost per additional case prevented for screening all children compared with targeted screening (+34 666) is more than twice as high as treatment and contact tracing for a case of tuberculosis (+16 392). CONCLUSIONS: Targeted screening of schoolchildren is much less costly than mass screening and is more efficient in prevention of tuberculosis.},

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches of electronic databases 1950 to November 2013, checking of reference lists, hand searching of journals, and contact with experts. SETTING: Community congregate settings and households. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Vaccinated and unvaccinated children aged under 16 with known recent exposure to patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Children were screened for infection with M tuberculosis with interferon $\gamma$ release assays. DATA EXTRACTION: Study results relating to diagnostic accuracy were extracted and risk estimates were combined with random effects meta-analysis. RESULTS: The primary analysis included 14 studies and 3855 participants. The estimated overall risk ratio was 0.81 (95{\%} confidence interval 0.71 to 0.92), indicating a protective efficacy of 19{\%} against infection among vaccinated children after exposure compared with unvaccinated children. The observed protection was similar when estimated with the two types of interferon $\gamma$ release assays (ELISpot or QuantiFERON). Restriction of the analysis to the six studies (n=1745) with information on progression to active tuberculosis at the time of screening showed protection against infection of 27{\%} (risk ratio 0.73, 0.61 to 0.87) compared with 71{\%} (0.29, 0.15 to 0.58) against active tuberculosis. Among those infected, protection against progression to disease was 58{\%} (0.42, 0.23 to 0.77).

abstract = {Late 19th century epidemics of tuberculosis (TB) in Western Canadian First Nations resulted in peak TB mortality rates more than six times the highest rates recorded in Europe. Using a mathematical modeling approach and historical TB mortality time series, we investigate potential causes of high TB mortality and rapid epidemic decline in First Nations from 1885 to 1940. We explore two potential causes of dramatic epidemic dynamics observed in this setting: first, we explore effects of famine prior to 1900 on both TB and population dynamics. Malnutrition is recognized as an individual-level risk factor for TB progression and mortality; its population-level effects on TB epidemics have not been explored previously. Second, we explore effects of heterogeneity in susceptibility to TB in two ways: modeling heterogeneity in susceptibility to infection, and heterogeneity in risk of developing disease once infected. Our results indicate that models lacking famine-related changes in TB parameters or heterogeneity result in an implausibly poor fit to both the TB mortality time series and census data; the inclusion of these features allows for the characteristic decline and rise in population observed in First Nations during this time period and confers improved fits to TB mortality data.},

OBJECTIVES: To compare Mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tube (MGIT) with Lowenstein-Jensen (LJ) medium with regard to Mycobacterium tuberculosis yield, time to positive culture and contamination, and to assess MGIT cost-effectiveness. DESIGN: Sputum from gold miners was cultured on MGIT and LJ. We estimated cost per culture, and, for smear-negative samples, incremental cost per additional M. tuberculosis gained with MGIT using a decision-tree model. RESULTS: Among 1267 specimens, MGIT vs. LJ gave a higher yield of mycobacteria (29.7{\%} vs. 22.8{\%}), higher contamination (16.7{\%} vs. 9.3{\%}) and shorter time to positive culture (median 14 vs. 25 days for smear-negative specimens). Among smear-negative samples that were culture-positive on MGIT but negative/contaminated on LJ, 77.3{\%} were non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM). Cost per culture on LJ, MGIT and MGIT+LJ was respectively US{\$}12.35, US{\$}16.62 and US{\$}19.29. The incremental cost per additional M. tuberculosis identified by standard biochemical tests and microscopic cording was respectively US{\$}504.08 and US{\$}328.10 using MGIT vs. LJ, or US{\$}160.80 and US{\$}{\$}109.07 using MGIT+LJ vs. LJ alone. CONCLUSION: MGIT gives higher yield and faster results at relatively high cost. The high proportion of NTM underscores the need for rapid speciation tests.

abstract = {the extent to which reinfection of latently infected individuals contributes to the dynamics of tuberculosis (TB) epidemics. In this study we present an epidemiological model of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection that includes the process of reinfection. Using analysis and numerical simulations, we observe the effect that varying levels of reinfection has on the qualitative dynamics of the TB epidemic. We examine cases of the model both with and without treatment of actively infected individuals. Next, we consider a variation of the model describing a heterogeneous population, stratified by susceptibility to TB infection. Results show that a threshold level of reinfection exists in all cases of the model. Beyond this threshold, the dynamics of the model are described by a backward bifurcation. Uncertainty analysis of the parameters shows that this threshold is too high to be attained in a realistic epidemic. However, we show that even for sub-threshold levels of reinfection, including reinfection in the model changes dynamic behavior of the model. In particular, when reinfection is present the basic reproductive number, R(0), does not accurately describe the severity of an epidemic.},

abstract = {SETTING: Various methods have been used to estimate the prevalence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection from tuberculin survey data. All are complicated by prior sensitisation to environmental mycobacteria and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination. Mixture analysis has recently been proposed as a means of overcoming misclassification and improving infection prevalence estimates. OBJECTIVE: To compare conventional and mixture model estimates of M. tuberculosis infection prevalence. DESIGN: Mixture models with two or three univariate normal components were fitted to the results of 53 909 tuberculin tests conducted in northern Malawi during 1980-1984. Data were stratified by BCG status, sex and age and corrected for digit preference. Prevalence estimates derived from mixture models were compared with those of conventional methods. RESULTS: The optimal model was age-dependent, with three- and one-component solutions preferred in younger and older age groups, respectively. In contrast with findings from elsewhere, a component corresponding to BCG vaccination was indistinguishable from that attributable to environmental mycobacterial exposure, and infection prevalence estimates in younger individuals with a BCG scar were inflated, irrespective of the method used. CONCLUSION: The validity of infection prevalence and incidence estimates based on mixture modelling is probably locale-dependent, and the assumptions underlying mixture models may not realistically reflect underlying immunological processes.},

We used a Markov model to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the impact on life expectancy and costs based on the results of a recent clinical trial that compared the rates of adverse events and completion of the 2 treatment regimens. Compared with no treatment, both regimens increased life expectancy by 1.2 years, but RZ cost 273 dollars more per patient. Sensitivity analyses showed that, assuming equal efficacy between the 2 regimens, there was no threshold completion rate for RZ at which the 2 treatments would be of equal net cost. Under most circumstances, treatment of latent tuberculosis infection with isoniazid is cost-saving than treatment with RZ.},

Four- teen prospective trials and 12 case-control studies were included in the analysis. Data Extraction.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Werecorded study design, age range of study population, number of patients enrolled, efficacy of vaccine, and items to assess the potential for bias in study design and diagnosis.

Data Synthesis.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Therelative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) of TB provided the measure of vaccine efficacy that we analyzed. The protective effect was then com- puted by 1 $\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$RRor 1 $\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$OR.A random-effects model estimated a weighted average RR or OR from those provided by the trials or case-control studies. In the trials, the RR of TB was 0.49 (95{\%} confidence interval [Cl], 0.34 to 0.70) for vaccine recipi- ents compared with nonrecipients (protective effect of 51{\%}). In the case-control studies, the OR for TB was 0.50 (95{\%} CI, 0.39 to 0.64), or a 50{\%} protective effect. Seven trials reporting tuberculous deaths showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 71{\%} (RR, 0.29; 95{\%} Cl, 0.16 to 0.53), and five studies reporting on meningitis showed a protective effect from BCG vaccine of 64{\%} (OR, 0.36; 95{\%} Cl, 0.18 to 0.70).

Conclusion.$\backslash$p=m-$\backslash$Onaverage, BCG vaccine significantly reduces the risk of TB by 50{\%}. Protection is observed across many populations, study designs, and forms of TB. Age at vaccination did not enhance predictiveness of BCG efficacy. Protec- tion against tuberculous death, meningitis, and disseminated disease is higher than for total TB cases, although this result may reflect reduced error in disease clas- sification rather than greater BCG efficacy.},

HIV co-infection is the stongest risk factor for progression of M. tuberculosis to active TB disease in HIV individuals, as well as TB has been accelerated to progression HIV infection. In this paper we create a model of transmission co-infection TB in HIV community, dynamic system with ten compartments built in here. Dynamic analysis in this paper mentioned ranging from disease free equilibrium conditions, endemic equilibrium conditions, basic reproduction ratio, stability analysis and numerical simulation. Basic reproductive ratio were obtained from spectral radius the next generation matrix of the model. Numerical simulations are built to justify the results of the analysis and to see the changes in the dynamics of the population in each compartment. The sensitivity analysis indicates that the parameters affecting the population dynamics of TB in people with HIV infection is parameters rate of progression of individuals from the exposed TB class to the active TB, treatment rate of exposed TB individuals, treatment rate of infectious (active TB) individuals and probability of transmission of TB infection from an infective to a susceptible per contact per unit time. We can conclude that growing number of infections carried by infectious TB in people with HIV infection can lead to increased spread of disease or increase in endemic conditions.},

DESIGN: A simple mathematical model is constructed using figures from published reports to estimate the rise of TB incidence as the HIV epidemic expands. METHOD: Two groups with different risk of developing TB are identified: individuals with dual infection of HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the rest of the population. The model is based on a combination of the incidence and the percentage of TB in these two groups. The expected rise in TB incidence and the percentage of TB cases that will be HIV-positive are plotted against the prevalence of HIV. CONCLUSIONS: Unless appropriate action is taken, TB incidence in developing countries will double as the prevalence of HIV infection reaches 13 per hundred adults.},

abstract = {Heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity is inherent to infectious disease transmission in nature. Here we are concerned with the formulation of mathematical models that capture the essence of heterogeneity while keeping a simple structure suitable of analytical treatment. We explore the consequences of host heterogeneity in the susceptibility to infection for epidemiological models for which immunity conferred by infection is partially protective, known as susceptible-infected-recovered-infected (SIRI) models. We analyze the impact of heterogeneity on disease prevalence and contrast the susceptibility profiles of the subpopulations at risk for primary infection and reinfection. We present a systematic study in the case of two frailty groups. We predict that the average rate of reinfection may be higher than the average rate of primary infection, which may seem paradoxical given that primary infection induces life-long partial protection. Infection generates a selection mechanism whereby fit individuals remain in S and frail individuals are transferred to R. If this effect is strong enough we have a scenario where, on average, the rate of reinfection is higher than the rate of primary infection even though each individual has a risk reduction following primary infection. This mechanism may explain high rates of tuberculosis reinfection recently reported. Finally, the enhanced benefits of vaccination strategies that target the high-risk groups are quantified.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: WHO recommends isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for young children in close contact with an infectious tuberculosis (TB) case. No models have examined the cost effectiveness of this recommendation. METHODS: A decision analysis model was developed to estimate health and economic outcomes of five TB infection screening strategies in young household contacts. In the no-testing strategy, children received IPT based on age and reported exposure. Other strategies included testing for infection with a tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or IGRA after TST. Markov modelling included age-specific disease states and probabilities while considering risk of re-infection in a high-burden country. RESULTS: Among the 0-2-year-old cohort, the no-testing strategy was most cost effective. The discounted societal cost of care per life year saved ranged from US{\$}237 (no-testing) to US{\$}538 (IGRA only testing). Among the 3-5-year-old cohort, strategies employing an IGRA after a negative TST were most effective, but were associated with significant incremental cost (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio {\textgreater}US{\$}233 000), depending on the rate of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. CONCLUSION: Screening for M tuberculosis infection and provision of IPT in young children is a highly cost-effective intervention. Screening without testing for M tuberculosis infection is the most cost-effective strategy in 0-2-year-old children and the preferred strategy in 3-5-year-old children. Lack of testing capacity should therefore not be a barrier to IPT delivery. These findings highlight the cost effectiveness of contact tracing and IPT delivery in young children exposed to TB in high-burden countries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic transmission models are increasingly being used to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). However, there has been no recent comprehensive review of this emerging field. This paper summarises how mathematical models have informed the field of HCAI and how methods have developed over time.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL plus and Global Health databases were systematically searched for dynamic mathematical models of HCAI transmission and/or the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: In total, 96 papers met the eligibility criteria. The main research themes considered were evaluation of infection control effectiveness (64{\%}), variability in transmission routes (7{\%}), the impact of movement patterns between healthcare institutes (5{\%}), the development of antimicrobial resistance (3{\%}), and strain competitiveness or co-colonisation with different strains (3{\%}). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly modelled HCAI (34{\%}), followed by vancomycin resistant enterococci (16{\%}). Other common HCAIs, e.g. Clostridum difficile, were rarely investigated (3{\%}). Very few models have been published on HCAI from low or middle-income countries.The first HCAI model has looked at antimicrobial resistance in hospital settings using compartmental deterministic approaches. Stochastic models (which include the role of chance in the transmission process) are becoming increasingly common. Model calibration (inference of unknown parameters by fitting models to data) and sensitivity analysis are comparatively uncommon, occurring in 35{\%} and 36{\%} of studies respectively, but their application is increasing. Only 5{\%} of models compared their predictions to external data.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Transmission models have been used to understand complex systems and to predict the impact of control policies. Methods have generally improved, with an increased use of stochastic models, and more advanced methods for formal model fitting and sensitivity analyses. Insights gained from these models could be broadened to a wider range of pathogens and settings. Improvements in the availability of data and statistical methods could enhance the predictive ability of models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Sputum smear microscopy is commonly used for diagnosing tuberculosis (TB). Although patients with sputum smear-negative TB are less infectious than patients with smear-positive TB, they also contribute to TB transmission. The objective of this study was to determine the proportion of TB transmission events caused by patients with smear-negative pulmonary TB in The Netherlands. METHODS: All patients in The Netherlands with culture-confirmed TB during the period 1996-2004 were included in this study. Patients with identical DNA fingerprints in Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates from sputum samples were clustered. The first patients in a cluster were considered to be the index patients; all other patients were considered to have secondary cases. In addition, we examined transmission from sources by conventional contact tracing. RESULTS: We analyzed 394 clusters with a total of 1285 patients. On the basis of molecular linkage only, 12.6{\%} of the secondary cases were attributable to transmission from a patient with smear-negative TB. The relative transmission rate among patients with smear-negative TB, compared with patients with smear-positive TB, was 0.24 (95{\%} confidence interval, 0.20-0.30). Secondary cases in clusters with an index patient with smear-negative TB more frequently had smear-negative status (odds ratio, 1.86; 95{\%} confidence interval, 1.18-2.93), compared with secondary cases in clusters with an index patient with smear-positive TB. Conventional contact tracing revealed that 26 (6.2{\%}) of the 417 sources, as identified by the Municipal Health Services, had smear-negative TB. CONCLUSIONS: In The Netherlands, patients with smear-negative, culture-positive TB are responsible for 13{\%} of TB transmission. Countries that have ample resources should expand their TB-control efforts to include prevention of transmission from patients with smear-negative, culture-positive pulmonary TB.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: New first-line drug regimens for treatment of tuberculosis (TB) are in clinical trials: emergence of resistance is a key concern. Because population-level data on resistance cannot be collected in advance, epidemiological models are important tools for understanding the drivers and dynamics of resistance before novel drug regimens are launched. METHODS: We developed a transmission model of TB after launch of a new drug regimen, defining drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) as resistance to the new regimen. The model is characterized by (1) the probability of acquiring resistance during treatment, (2) the transmission fitness of DR-TB relative to drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB), and (3) the probability of treatment success for DR-TB versus DS-TB. We evaluate the effect of each factor on future DR-TB prevalence, defined as the proportion of incident TB that is drug-resistant. RESULTS: Probability of acquired resistance was the strongest predictor of the DR-TB proportion in the first 5 years after the launch of a new drug regimen. Over a longer term, however, the DR-TB proportion was driven by the resistant population's transmission fitness and treatment success rates. Regardless of uncertainty in acquisition probability and transmission fitness, high levels ({\textgreater}10{\%}) of drug resistance were unlikely to emerge within 50 years if, among all cases of TB that were detected, 85{\%} of those with DR-TB could be appropriately diagnosed as such and then successfully treated. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term surveillance cannot predict long-term drug resistance trends after launch of novel first-line TB regimens. Ensuring high treatment success of drug-resistant TB through early diagnosis and appropriate second-line therapy can mitigate many epidemiological uncertainties and may substantially slow the emergence of drug-resistant TB.},

Sixteen (27{\%}) PCTs reported universal infant vaccination and 111 (73{\%}) had selective infant vaccination. Selective vaccination outside infancy was also reported from 94 (74{\%}) PCTs. PCTs with selective infant policy most frequently vaccinated on postnatal wards (51/102, 50{\%}), whereas PCTs with universal infant vaccination most frequently vaccinated in community clinics (9/13, 69{\%}; p=0.011). To identify and flag up eligible infants in PCTs with targeted infant immunisation, those who mostly vaccinate on postnatal wards depend on midwives and maternity records, whereas those who vaccinate primarily in the community rely more often on various healthcare professionals.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Targeted infant vaccination has been implemented in most PCTs across the UK. PCTs with selective infant vaccination provide BCG vaccine via a greater variety of healthcare professionals than those with universal infant vaccination policies. Data on vaccine coverage would help evaluate the effectiveness of delivery. Interruptions of delivery noted here emphasise the importance of not just an agreed, standardised, local pathway, but also a named person in charge.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To examine factors responsible for the recent increase in tuberculosis in England and Wales. DESIGN: Study of the incidence of tuberculosis (a) in the 403 local authority districts in England and Wales, ranked according to Jarman score, and (b) in one deprived inner city district, according to ethnic origin and other factors. SETTING: (a) England and Wales 1980-92, and (b) the London borough of Hackney 1986-93. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Age and sex adjusted rate of tuberculosis. RESULTS: In England and Wales notifications of tuberculosis increased by 12{\%} between 1988 and 1992. The increase was 35{\%} in the poorest 10th of the population and 13{\%} in the next two; and in the remaining 70{\%} there was no increase. In Hackney the increase affected traditionally high risk and low risk ethnic groups to a similar extent. In the "low risk" white and West Indian communities the incidence increased by 58{\%} from 1986-8 (78 cases) to 1991-3 (123), whereas in residents of Indian subcontinent origin the increase was 41{\%} (from 51 cases to 72). Tuberculosis in recently arrived immigrants--refugees (11{\%} of the Hackney population) and Africans (6{\%})--accounted for less than half of the overall increase, and the proportion of such residents was much higher than in most socioeconomically deprived districts. The local increase was not due to an increase in the proportion of cases notified, to HIV infection, nor to an increase in homeless people. CONCLUSIONS: The national rise in tuberculosis affects only the poorest areas. Within one such area all residents (white and established ethnic minorities) were affected to a similar extent. The evidence indicates a major role for socioeconomic factors in the increase in tuberculosis and only a minor role for recent immigration from endemic areas.},

U-duality is used as the main tool and guideline in uncovering the spectrum of BPS states. We review the 11D supergravity algebra and elementary 1/2-BPS solutions, discuss T-duality in the perturbative and non-perturbative sectors from an algebraic point of view, and apply the same tools to the analysis of U-duality at the level of the effective action and the BPS spectrum, with a particular emphasis on Weyl and Borel generators. We derive the U-duality multiplets of BPS particles and strings, U-duality invariant mass formulae for 1/2- and 1/4-BPS states for general toroidal compactifications on skew tori with gauge backgrounds, and U-duality multiplets of constraints for states to preserve a given fraction of supersymmetry. A number of mysterious states are encountered in D{\textless}=3, whose existence is implied by T-duality and 11D Lorentz invariance. We then move to the M(atrix) theory point of view, give an introduction to Discrete Light Cone Quantization (DLCQ) in general and DLCQ of M-theory in particular. We discuss the realization of U-duality as electric-magnetic dualities of the Matrix gauge theory, display the Matrix gauge theory BPS spectrum in detail, and discuss the conjectured extended U-duality group in this scheme.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) programs must invest in a variety of TB specific activities in order to reach ambitious global targets. Uncertainty exists surrounding the potential impact of each of these activities. The objective of our study was to model different interventions and quantify their impact on epidemiologic outcomes and costs from the health system perspective. METHODS: Decision analysis was used to define the TB patient trajectory within the health system of three different countries. We considered up to seven different interventions that could affect either the natural history of TB, or patient trajectories within the health system. The expected impact of interventions were derived from published studies where possible. Epidemiologic outcomes and associated health system costs were projected for each scenario. RESULTS: With no specific intervention, TB related death rates are high and less than 10{\%} of the population starts on correct treatment. Interventions that either prevent cases or affect all patients with TB disease early in their trajectory are expected to have the biggest impact, regardless of underlying epidemiologic characteristics of the setting. In settings with a private sector, improving diagnosis and appropriate treatment across all sectors is expected to have a major impact on outcomes. CONCLUSION: In all settings, the greatest benefit will come from early diagnosis of all forms of TB. Once this has been achieved more specific interventions, such as those targeting HIV, drug resistance or the private sector can be integrated to increase impact.},

The time-dependent uncertainty analysis enabled us to evaluate the variability in the epidemiological outcome variables of the model during the progression of a tuberculosis epidemic. Calculated values (from the uncertainty analysis) for the disease incidence, disease prevalence, and mortality rates were approximately consistent with historical data. The time-dependent sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few of the model's input parameters significantly affected the severity of a tuberculosis epidemic; these parameters were the disease reactivation rate, the fraction of infected individuals who develop tuberculosis soon after infection, the number of individuals that an infectious individual infects per year, the disease death rate, and the population recruitment rate. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to improve our understanding of the behavior of tuberculosis epidemics by applying time-dependent uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to a transmission model.},

abstract = {Recent and rapidly evolving progress on high-throughput measurement techniques and computational performance has led to the emergence of new disciplines, such as systems medicine and translational systems biology. At the core of these disciplines lies the desire to produce multiscale models: mathematical models that integrate multiple scales of biological organization, ranging from molecular, cellular and tissue models to organ, whole-organism and population scale models. Using such models, hypotheses can systematically be tested. In this review, we present state-of-the-art multiscale modelling of bacterial and fungal infections, considering both the pathogen and host as well as their interaction. Multiscale modelling of the interactions of bacteria, especially Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with the human host is quite advanced. In contrast, models for fungal infections are still in their infancy, in particular regarding infections with the most important human pathogenic fungi, Candida albicans and Aspergillus fumigatus. We reflect on the current availability of computational approaches for multiscale modelling of host-pathogen interactions and point out current challenges. Finally, we provide an outlook for future requirements of multiscale modelling.},

The analytical results show that the low rates in tuberculosis notifications over the period 1971-1981 have changed, halting in 1982 and reversing with high incidence from 1983 onwards. An annual seasonal pattern was also shown with higher incidence during summer and autumn. With the mathematical model we predicted the disease behaviour in 1997 and the results were compared to the reported cases. In Spain, as in several industrialised countries, the reason for this recent increase in the number of reported cases is, mainly, the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. The seasonal trend, with higher incidence in winter, can be attributed to the increase in indoor activities, much more common than in a warm climate. The tubercle bacilli expelled from infected persons in a room with closed windows may remain infectious for a long time, increasing the risk of exposure of healthy persons to the bacilli. As the preclinical period, from exposure to clinical onset, may be of several weeks, the high incidence in spring would be explained. Moreover, in winter and spring the infections of viral aetiology, like flu, are more frequent and cause immunological deficiency which is another reason for the seasonal trend observed. An incidence greater than that foreseen by the mathematical model would express a failure in epidemiologic surveillance, and thus the results of this study may be used to assess a quality of the preventive measures.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) recurrence can be due to reinfection or relapse. The contribution of each to TB incidence and the factors associated with recurrence are not well known. Effectiveness of TB control programs is assessed in part by recurrence rates. The aim of this study was to establish the recurrence rate of TB in Barcelona, the associated risk factors and the role of reinfection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A population-based retrospective longitudinal study was performed in Barcelona, Spain. TB patients with positive culture results who completed treatment between Jan 1(st), 2003 and Dec 31(st), 2006 were followed-up until December 31st, 2009 by the TB Control Program. The incidence rate of recurrence was calculated per person-year of follow-up (py). Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods were used for the survival analysis by calculating the hazard ratio (HR) with 95{\%} confidence intervals (CI).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Of the 1,823 TB cases identified, 971 fulfilled the inclusion criteria and 13 (1.3{\%}) had recurrent TB. The recurrence rate was 341 cases per 100,000 py, 13 times higher than the TB incidence of the general population. Likelihood of TB recurrence at the 1st, 3rd and 5th year of follow-up was 0.1{\%}, 1.4{\%} and 1.6{\%}, respectively. Factors associated with recurrence were HIV infection (HR: 4.7, CI: 1.4-15.7), living in the inner city district (HR: 3.9, CI: 1.3-11.8) and history of TB treatment (HR: 5.2, CI: 1.7-16.2). Genotyping results of recurrent cases were available for 6 patients (3 reinfections and 3 relapses).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: The rate of TB recurrence in Barcelona is low and most episodes occur within the first three years. Patients at higher risk of recurrence are co-infected with HIV, living in neighborhoods with high TB incidence or with a history of TB treatment. When available, genotyping results help determine whether the recurrence is due to reinfection or relapse.},

abstract = {Mathematical models have recently been used to predict the future burden of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB). These models suggest the threat of multidrug resistance to TB control will depend on the relative 'fitness' of MDR strains and imply that if the average fitness of MDR strains is considerably less than that of drug-sensitive strains, the emergence of resistance will not jeopardize the success of tuberculosis control efforts. Multidrug resistance in M. tuberculosis is conferred by the sequential acquisition of a number of different single-locus mutations that have been shown to have heterogeneous phenotypic effects. Here we model the impact of initial fitness estimates on the emergence of MDRTB assuming that the relative fitness of MDR strains is heterogeneous. We find that even when the average relative fitness of MDR strains is low and a well-functioning control program is in place, a small subpopulation of a relatively fit MDR strain may eventually outcompete both the drug-sensitive strains and the less fit MDR strains. These results imply that current epidemiological measures and short-term trends in the burden of MDRTB do not provide evidence that MDRTB strains can be contained in the absence of specific efforts to limit transmission from those with MDR disease.},

abstract = {Recognizing that tuberculosis (TB) is still the leading cause of human death from a curable infection, the international health community has set ambitious targets for disease control. One target is to eliminate TB by 2050; that is, to cut the annual incidence of new cases to less than 1 per million population. National TB control programmes are working to eliminate TB mainly by intensifying efforts to find and cure patients with active disease. Here, we use mathematical modelling to show that, while most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent infection and active disease. We find that the coupling of control methods is particularly effective because treatments for latent infection and active disease act in synergy. This synergistic effect offers new perspectives on the cost-effectiveness of treating latent TB infection and the impact of possible new TB vaccines. Our results should be a stimulus to those who develop, manufacture and implement new technology for TB control, and to their financial donors.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Between April 2001 and March 2004, the Directly Observed Therapy-Short course (DOTS) program was successfully implemented by the National Tuberculosis control program, with assistance from the Canadian Lung Association, in three provinces of Ecuador, where 52{\%} of the population of the country reside. METHODS: Markov modelling was used to project TB-related morbidity, mortality and costs if the former TB control program (status quo) had continued or if the newly expanded DOTS program is maintained over 20 years. Extensive sensitivity analyses were used to determine the effect on projected outcomes of varying key assumptions. RESULTS: If DOTS is maintained over the next 20 years, we predict that 18,760 cases and 15,812 TB-related deaths will be prevented, resulting in societal savings of dollars 203 million and government savings of dollars 7.1 million (all costs in dollars US). These findings were robust in extensive sensitivity analyses. Given the initial investment of dollars 3 million for DOTS implementation, this would mean a cost of dollars 190 per life saved. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of DOTS could yield very substantial public health and economic benefits for Ecuador. These results demonstrate the benefits from Canadian government support for DOTS implementation in low- and middle-income countries.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine tuberculosis (TB) population dynamics and to assess potential infection risk in Taiwan. A well-established mathematical model of TB transmission built on previous models was adopted to study the potential impact of TB transmission. A probabilistic risk model was also developed to estimate site-specific risks of developing disease soon after recent primary infection, exogenous reinfection, or through endogenous reactivation (latently infected TB) among Taiwan regions. Here, we showed that the proportion of endogenous reactivation (53-67{\%}) was larger than that of exogenous reinfection (32-47{\%}). Our simulations showed that as epidemic reaches a steady state, age distribution of cases would finally shift toward older age groups dominated by latently infected TB cases as a result of endogenous reactivation. A comparison of age-weighted TB incidence data with our model simulation output with 95{\%} credible intervals revealed that the predictions were in an apparent agreement with observed data. The median value of overall basic reproduction number (R(0) ) in eastern Taiwan ranged from 1.65 to 1.72, whereas northern Taiwan had the lowest R(0) estimate of 1.50. We found that total TB incidences in eastern Taiwan had 25-27{\%} probabilities of total proportion of infected population exceeding 90{\%}, whereas there were 36-66{\%} probabilities having exceeded 20{\%} of total proportion of infected population attributed to latently infected TB. We suggested that our Taiwan-based analysis can be extended to the context of developing countries, where TB remains a substantial cause of elderly morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In Uganda, isoniazid plus ethambutol is used for 6 months (6HE) during the continuation treatment phase of new tuberculosis (TB) cases. However, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using isoniazid plus rifampicin for 4 months (4HR) instead of 6HE. We compared the impact of a continuation phase using 6HE or 4HR on total cost and expected mortality from the perspective of the Ugandan national health system. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Treatment costs and outcomes were determined by decision analysis. Median daily drug price was US{\$}0.115 for HR and US{\$}0.069 for HE. TB treatment failure or relapse and mortality rates associated with 6HE vs. 4HR were obtained from randomized trials and systematic reviews for HIV-negative (46{\%} of TB cases; failure/relapse -6HE: 10.4{\%} vs. 4HR: 5.2{\%}; mortality -6HE: 5.6{\%} vs. 4HR: 3.5{\%}) and HIV-positive patients (54{\%} of TB cases; failure or relapse -6HE: 13.7{\%} vs. 4HR: 12.4{\%}; mortality -6HE: 16.6{\%} vs. 4HR: 10.5{\%}). When the initial treatment is not successful, retreatment involves an additional 8-month drug-regimen at a cost of {\$}110.70. The model predicted a mortality rate of 13.3{\%} for patients treated with 6HE and 8.8{\%} for 4HR; average treatment cost per patient was predicted at {\$}26.07 for 6HE and {\$}23.64 for 4HR. These results were robust to the inclusion of MDR-TB as an additional outcome after treatment failure or relapse. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Combination therapy with 4HR in the continuation phase dominates 6HE as it is associated with both lower expected costs and lower expected mortality. These data support the WHO recommendation to transition to a continuation phase comprising 4HR.},

abstract = {In this paper, the cumulative effect of ecological factors in the habitat on the spread of tuberculosis (TB) in human population is modeled and analyzed. The total human population is divided into two classes, susceptibles and infectives. It is assumed that TB is not only spread by direct contacts with infectives in the population but also indirectly by bacteria which are emitted by infectives in the habitat. It is assumed further that bacteria survive due to conducive ecological factors such as flower pots, plants, grasses, human clothes, etc. in the habitat. The cumulative density of ecological factors in the habitat is assumed to be governed by a population density dependent logistic model. The analysis of the model shows that as parameters governing the conducive ecological factors in the habitat increase, the spread of TB increases. The same result is also found with the increase in the parameter governing the survival and accumulation of bacteria in the habitat. It is further found that due to immigration of the population TB becomes more endemic. A numerical study of the model is also carried out to support the analytical results.},

abstract = {Following primary tuberculosis (TB) infection, only approximately 10{\%} of individuals develop active T.B. Most people are assumed to mount an effective immune response to the initial infection that limits proliferation of the bacilli and leads to long-lasting partial immunity both to further infection and to reactivation of latent bacilli remaining from the original infection. Infected individuals may develop active TB as a consequence of exogenous reinfection, i.e., acquiring a new infection from another infectious individual. Our results in this paper suggest that exogenous reinfection has a drastic effect on the qualitative dynamics of TB. The incorporation of exogenous reinfection into our TB model allows the possibility of a subcritical bifurcation at the critical value of the basic reproductive number R(0)=1, and hence the existence of multiple endemic equilibria for R(0){\textless}1 and the exogenous reinfection rate larger than a threshold. Our results suggest that reducing R(0) to be smaller than one may not be sufficient to eradicate the disease. An additional reduction in reinfection rate may be required. These results may also partially explain the recently observed resurgence of TB.},

abstract = {For pathogens that must be treated with combinations of antibiotics and acquire resistance through genetic mutation, knowledge of the order in which drug-resistance mutations occur may be important for determining treatment policies. Diagnostic specimens collected from patients are often available; this makes it possible to determine the presence of individual drug resistance-conferring mutations and combinations of these mutations. In most cases, these specimens are only available from a patient at a single point in time; it is very rare to have access to multiple specimens from a single patient collected over time as resistance accumulates to multiple drugs. Statistical methods that use branching trees have been successfully applied to such cross-sectional data to make inference on the ordering of events that occurred prior to sampling. Here, we propose a Bayesian approach to fitting branching tree models that has several advantages, including the ability to accommodate prior information regarding measurement error or cross resistance and the natural way it permits the characterization of uncertainty. Our methods are applied to a data set for drug-resistant TB in Peru; the goal of the analysis was to determine the order with which patients develop resistance to the drugs commonly used for treating TB in this setting.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis has been declining in developed countries for a long time, as a result of the intrinsic epidemiological characteristics of this disease, combined with improvement in the standard of living and more recently the use of antibiotics. In these low prevalence countries, decisions concerning the objectives of tuberculosis programmes have to be taken and the consequences of short term changes in the sanitary situation have to be assessed. METHODS: A deterministic model, without age structure, of the dynamics of pulmonary tuberculosis is proposed. The model extends that of Waaler and is intended to be more suitable for application to developed countries. The flows between seven subgroups of population, based on the natural history of the disease, are modelled and vaccination is taken into account. Values of model parameters and initial prevalences were deduced from published data. RESULTS: As a first step, qualitative comparisons are performed between the model-predicted decline in the annual risk of infection (ARI) and data from the Netherlands tuberculosis survey. Using parameter values suited to France, our model shows that the predicted decline is slower in France than in the Netherlands; a result which tallies with epidemiological observations. Uses of the model as a decision tool are illustrated in two cases, that of ending systematic BCG vaccination and that of a sudden increase in the number of infectious cases.},

abstract = {Different combinations of coverage levels of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment may achieve the same problem reduction in epidemiological terms. But the same problem reduction, in man-years of tuberculosis, may be valued differently in social terms. A social-time-preference parameter, of the form 1/(1+r)t, is relevant to this evaluation and the level of r is critical for policy decision. The present paper studies the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment to the level of r, and the epidemiological mechanism underlying such sensitivity. A high value of r can be visualized as corresponding to a close planning horizon, a lower value of r to a more distant one. At any level of epidemiological effectiveness, a planner with a high value of r would favour case-finding and treatment, and a planner with a low value of r would tend to emphasize BCG vaccination. This influence of the social-time-preference parameter on the planner's decision is found to depend on the discounting effect of the parameter on the one hand, and on the different age- and time-patterns of the preventive effect of the major control measures, on the other.},

abstract = {Infectious diseases and their transmission are good examples of complex systems, with several interacting and interdependent components. We develop an agent-based simulation of the living condition of a typical slum setting in Nigeria which is considered to have a higher incidence and prevalence of tuberculosis. We consider the epidemiology of the disease and create a dynamic model, incorporating both environmental conditions and immune suppressed health conditions that have been observed in previous studies to be associated with emergence of the disease. Based on the developed model, we observe the pattern of transmission and we compare the results obtained with the estimates provided by the World Health Organization (WHO) and other individual surveys carried out in the past. The results obtained showed that increasing the air changes per hour (ACH) reduces the number of new latent tuberculosis infections among close contacts. Incorporating 7 air changes per hour which is the recommended value for a bedroom had a significance impact in reducing the number of new latent infections. Furthermore, introducing about 13 air changes per hour which is the recommended value for a smoking environment had a further reduction in the number of new latent infections. The result obtained also showed that individuals living with both HIV and diabetes have the highest risk of progressing to the active tuberculosis disease. Finally, the results also revealed that close contacts of people living with the active tuberculosis disease have a higher risk of developing the latent tuberculosis infection. These insights are useful findings to support public health policies for tuberculosis management.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prisons are recognised internationally as institutions with very high tuberculosis (TB) burdens where transmission is predominantly determined by contact between infectious and susceptible prisoners. A recent South African court case described the conditions under which prisoners awaiting trial were kept. With the use of these data, a mathematical model was developed to explore the interactions between incarceration conditions and TB control measures. METHODS: Cell dimensions, cell occupancy, lock-up time, TB incidence and treatment delays were derived from court evidence and judicial reports. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between prisoners, we estimated the current TB transmission probability within prison cells, and estimated transmission probabilities of improved levels of case finding in combination with implementation of national and international minimum standards for incarceration. RESULTS: Levels of overcrowding (230{\%}) in communal cells and poor TB case finding result in annual TB transmission risks of 90{\%} per annum. Implementing current national or international cell occupancy recommendations would reduce TB transmission probabilities by 30{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively. Improved passive case finding, modest ventilation increase or decreased lock-up time would minimally impact on transmission if introduced individually. However, active case finding together with implementation of minimum national and international standards of incarceration could reduce transmission by 50{\%} and 94{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Current conditions of detention for awaiting-trial prisoners are highly conducive for spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Combinations of simple well-established scientific control measures should be implemented urgently.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contact tracing is a key element in England's 2015 collaborative TB strategy, although proposed indicators of successful contact tracing remain undescribed. METHODS: We conducted descriptive and multivariable analyses of contact tracing of TB cases in London between 1 July 2012 and 31 December 2015 using cohort review data from London's TB Register, identifying characteristics associated with improved indicators and yield. RESULTS: Of the pulmonary TB cases notified, 60{\%} (2716/4561) had sufficient information for inclusion. Of these, 91{\%} (2481/2716) had at least 1 contact (median: 4/case (IQR: 2-6)) identified, with 86{\%} (10 251/11 981) of these contacts evaluated. 4.1{\%} (177/4328), 1.3{\%} (45/3421) and 0.70{\%} (51/7264) of evaluated contacts of pulmonary smear-positive, pulmonary smear-negative and non-pulmonary cases, respectively, had active disease. Cases who were former prisoners or male were less likely to have at least one contact identified than those never imprisoned or female, respectively. Cases diagnosed at clinics with more directly observed therapy or social workers were more likely to have one or more contacts identified. Contacts screened at a different clinic to their index case or of male index cases were less likely to be evaluated than those screened at the same clinic or of women, respectively; yield of active disease was similar by sex. 10{\%} (490/4850) of evaluated child contacts had latent TB infection. CONCLUSIONS: These are the first London-wide estimates of TB contact tracing indicators which are important for monitoring the strategy's success and informing risk assessment of index cases. Understanding why differences in indicators occur between groups could improve contact tracing outcomes.},

Here, we offer a first-time comprehensive review of work on within-host TB models that describe the immune response to infection, including the formation of lung granulomas. The models include systems of ordinary and partial differential equations and agent-based models as well as hybrid and multi-scale models that are combinations of these. Many aspects of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, including host dynamics in the lung (typical site of infection for TB), granuloma formation, roles of cytokine and chemokine dynamics, and bacterial nutrient availability have been explored. Finally, we survey applications of these within-host models to TB therapy and prevention and suggest future directions to impact this global disease.},

Although reporting to the Health Protec-tion Agency (HPA) has gradually improved since the inception of monitoring in 2002, outcomes remain unknown for approximately 20{\%} of cases. 4 When a death is recorded, the date of death and the contribu-tion of TB to that death are often unknown.

abstract = {Vaccine effect, as measured in clinical trials, may not accurately reflect population-level impact. Furthermore, little is known about how sensitive apparent or real vaccine impacts are to factors such as the risk of re-infection or the mechanism of protection. We present a dynamic compartmental model to simulate vaccination for endemic infections. Several measures of effectiveness are calculated to compare the real and apparent impact of vaccination, and assess the effect of a range of infection and vaccine characteristics on these measures. Although broadly correlated, measures of real and apparent vaccine effectiveness can differ widely. Vaccine impact is markedly underestimated when primary infection provides partial natural immunity, when coverage is high and when post-vaccination infectiousness is reduced. Despite equivalent efficacy, 'all or nothing' vaccines are more effective than 'leaky' vaccines, particularly in settings with high risk of re-infection and transmissibility. Latent periods result in greater real impacts when risk of re-infection is high, but this effect diminishes if partial natural immunity is assumed. Assessments of population-level vaccine effects against endemic infections from clinical trials may be significantly biased, and vaccine and infection characteristics should be considered when modelling outcomes of vaccination programs, as their impact may be dramatic.},

The ten-compartment deterministic model captures many of the observed phenomena important to disease dynamics, including partial and temporary vaccine efficacy, declining risk of active disease following infection, the possibility of reinfection both during the infection latent period and after treatment, multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) and de novo resistance during treatment. We found that the model could not be calibrated to the estimated incidence rate without allowing for reinfection during latency, and that even in the presence of a moderate fitness cost and a lower value of R0, MDR-TB becomes the dominant strain at equilibrium. Of the modifiable programmatic parameters, the rate of detection and treatment commencement was the most important determinant of disease rates with each respective strain, while vaccination rates were less important. Improved treatment of drug-susceptible TB did not result in decreased rates of MDR-TB through prevention of de novo resistance, but rather resulted in a modest increase in MDR-TB through strain replacement. This was due to the considerably greater relative contribution of community transmission to MDR-TB incidence, by comparison to de novo amplification of resistance in previously susceptible strains.},

abstract = {Metabolism is central to cell physiology, and metabolic disturbances play a role in numerous disease states. Despite its importance, the ability to study metabolism at a global scale using genomic technologies is limited. In principle, complete genome sequences describe the range of metabolic reactions that are possible for an organism, but cannot quantitatively describe the behaviour of these reactions. We present a novel method for modeling metabolic states using whole cell measurements of gene expression. Our method, which we call E-Flux (as a combination of flux and expression), extends the technique of Flux Balance Analysis by modeling maximum flux constraints as a function of measured gene expression. In contrast to previous methods for metabolically interpreting gene expression data, E-Flux utilizes a model of the underlying metabolic network to directly predict changes in metabolic flux capacity. We applied E-Flux to Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). Key components of mycobacterial cell walls are mycolic acids which are targets for several first-line TB drugs. We used E-Flux to predict the impact of 75 different drugs, drug combinations, and nutrient conditions on mycolic acid biosynthesis capacity in M. tuberculosis, using a public compendium of over 400 expression arrays. We tested our method using a model of mycolic acid biosynthesis as well as on a genome-scale model of M. tuberculosis metabolism. Our method correctly predicts seven of the eight known fatty acid inhibitors in this compendium and makes accurate predictions regarding the specificity of these compounds for fatty acid biosynthesis. Our method also predicts a number of additional potential modulators of TB mycolic acid biosynthesis. E-Flux thus provides a promising new approach for algorithmically predicting metabolic state from gene expression data.},

This article documents mice 2.9, which extends the functionality of mice 1.0 in several ways. In mice 2.9, the analysis of imputed data is made completely general, whereas the range ofmodels under which pooling works is substantially extended. mice 2.9 adds new functionality for imputing multilevel data, automatic predictor selection, data handling, post-processing imputed values, specialized pooling routines, model selection tools, and diagnostic graphs. Imputation of categorical data is improved in order to bypass problems caused by perfect prediction. Special attention is paid to transformations, sum scores, indices and interactions using passive imputation, and to the proper setup of the predictor matrix. mice 2.9 can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network. This article provides a hands-on, stepwise approach to solve applied incomplete data problems.},

abstract = {Concerns have been raised about whether the interaction between tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) may lead worldwide to a recrudescent tuberculosis pandemic. These concerns are particularly grave in Africa which has a high prevalence of both tuberculosis and HIV. This study used a computer simulation model to examine the effect of tuberculosis-HIV interactions on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality in Africa. The model then assessed the impact of expanding treatment and chemoprophylaxis programmes on tuberculosis prevalence and mortality over the next decade. In communities where 20{\%} of the population is infected with HIV and 25{\%} receive treatment for tuberculosis, deaths from tuberculosis would be 100{\%} higher than in communities where none of the population is HIV-infected. In a population the size of Uganda's, during one decade there would be approximately an additional 530,000 deaths from tuberculosis. When 50{\%} of patients with active tuberculosis receive treatment, one death will be averted for every 2.5 people who receive treatment. The prevalence of active tuberculosis could be cut by over 90{\%} in a decade by providing effective chemoprophylaxis to 30{\%} of individuals with inactive TB. In conclusion, TB is only one example of a preventable and treatable infectious disease which can be spread through casual contact and which, because of its higher prevalence among the HIV positive population, may lead to a preventable increase in incidence of infection among the general population.},

abstract = {Highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A viruses are now endemic in avian populations in Southeast Asia, and human cases continue to accumulate. Although currently incapable of sustained human-to-human transmission, H5N1 represents a serious pandemic threat owing to the risk of a mutation or reassortment generating a virus with increased transmissibility. Identifying public health interventions that might be able to halt a pandemic in its earliest stages is therefore a priority. Here we use a simulation model of influenza transmission in Southeast Asia to evaluate the potential effectiveness of targeted mass prophylactic use of antiviral drugs as a containment strategy. Other interventions aimed at reducing population contact rates are also examined as reinforcements to an antiviral-based containment policy. We show that elimination of a nascent pandemic may be feasible using a combination of geographically targeted prophylaxis and social distancing measures, if the basic reproduction number of the new virus is below 1.8. We predict that a stockpile of 3 million courses of antiviral drugs should be sufficient for elimination. Policy effectiveness depends critically on how quickly clinical cases are diagnosed and the speed with which antiviral drugs can be distributed.},

abstract = {Treatment failure after therapy of pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) infections is an important challenge, especially when it coincides with de novo emergence of multi-drug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). We seek to explore possible causes why MDR-TB has been found to occur much more often in patients with a history of previous treatment. We develop a mathematical model of the replication of Mycobacterium tuberculosis within a patient reflecting the compartments of macrophages, granulomas, and open cavities as well as parameterizing the effects of drugs on the pathogen dynamics in these compartments. We use this model to study the influence of patient adherence to therapy and of common retreatment regimens on treatment outcome. As expected, the simulations show that treatment success increases with increasing adherence. However, treatment occasionally fails even under perfect adherence due to interpatient variability in pharmacological parameters. The risk of generating MDR de novo is highest between 40{\%} and 80{\%} adherence. Importantly, our simulations highlight the double-edged effect of retreatment: On the one hand, the recommended retreatment regimen increases the overall success rate compared to re-treating with the initial regimen. On the other hand, it increases the probability to accumulate more resistant genotypes. We conclude that treatment adherence is a key factor for a positive outcome, and that screening for resistant strains is advisable after treatment failure or relapse.},

abstract = {SETTING: England and Wales. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the magnitude and trend in the annual risk of infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1901. DESIGN: Estimates for the prechemotherapy era are derived assuming that 1{\%} of new infections among 0-4 year olds led to fatal tuberculosis meningitis, as found in the Netherlands. The estimates are validated against data from the 1949-1950 national tuberculin survey. We explore the trend thereafter using tuberculous meningitis notifications and data from the 1971-1973 national tuberculin survey, and discuss the utility of data collected under the national bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination scheme for estimating the annual risk of infection. RESULTS: Tuberculosis meningitis mortality rates among 0-4 year olds declined at 4{\%} per annum until 1950, and suggest that the annual risk of infection declined from 12{\%} in 1901 to 1.9{\%} in 1949. The decline in the annual risk of infection probably accelerated in 1950, although its magnitude cannot be determined accurately. CONCLUSION: An accelerated decline in the annual risk of infection in England and Wales from 1950 probably resulted from the introduction of chemotherapy, which dramatically reduced the prevalence of sources of infection in the population. Data collected during the national BCG vaccination scheme were found to be unsuitable for estimating infection risks.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Understanding the amount of tuberculosis managed by the private sector in India is crucial to understanding the true burden of the disease in the country, and thus globally. In the absence of quality surveillance data on privately treated patients, commercial drug sales data offer an empirical foundation for disease burden estimation. METHODS: We used a large, nationally representative commercial dataset on sales of 189 anti-tuberculosis products available in India to calculate the amount of anti-tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2013-14. We corrected estimates using validation studies that audited prescriptions against tuberculosis diagnosis, and estimated uncertainty using Monte Carlo simulation. To address implications for numbers of patients with tuberculosis, we explored varying assumptions for average duration of tuberculosis treatment and accuracy of private diagnosis. FINDINGS: There were 17.793 million patient-months (95{\%} credible interval 16.709 million to 19.841 million) of anti-tuberculosis treatment in the private sector in 2014, twice as many as the public sector. If 40-60{\%} of private-sector tuberculosis diagnoses are correct, and if private-sector tuberculosis treatment lasts on average 2-6 months, this implies that 1.19-5.34 million tuberculosis cases were treated in the private sector in 2014 alone. The midpoint of these ranges yields an estimate of 2.2 million cases, two to three times higher than currently assumed. INTERPRETATION: India's private sector is treating an enormous number of patients for tuberculosis, appreciably higher than has been previously recognised. Accordingly, there is a re-doubled need to address this burden and to strengthen surveillance. Tuberculosis burden estimates in India and worldwide require revision.

abstract = {HIV affects the pathogenesis and the transmission of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We used a discrete event simulation model to predict the potential impact of HIV on increasing the probability and the expected severity of tuberculosis outbreaks. Our predictions reveal that an HIV epidemic can significantly increase the frequency and severity of tuberculosis outbreaks, but that this amplification effect of HIV on tuberculosis outbreaks is very sensitive to the tuberculosis treatment rate. At moderate or low treatment rates, even a moderate HIV epidemic can cause the average size of tuberculosis outbreaks to almost double in comparison with the expected outbreak size when HIV is absent. However, we determined that the amplification effect of HIV can be substantially reduced if the treatment rate of tuberculosis is very high. We discuss the significant implications of these results for the global control of tuberculosis. Our results also reveal that occasionally a "normal-virulence" strain of M. tuberculosis can be expected to generate a large outbreak. We discuss the implications of these results in understanding the virulence of M. tuberculosis and in the planned elimination of tuberculosis in the United States.},

abstract = {This reviewpresents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be un- dertaken in moving fromtraditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that un- derly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assump- tions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coher- entmathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interven- tions, (also called “causal effects” or “policy evaluation”) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of “regret,” “attri- bution” or “causes of effects”) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as “mediation”). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.},

Based on data reported by the National Bureau of Statistics of China, the basic reproduction number is estimated approximately as R0=1.1892. To reach the new End TB goal raised by WHO in 2015, considering the health system in China, we design a mixed vaccination strategy. Theoretical analysis indicates that the infectious population asymptotically tends to zero with the new vaccination strategy which is the combination of constant vaccination and pulse vaccination. We obtain that the control of TB is quicker to achieve with the mixed vaccination. The new strategy can make the best of current constant vaccination, and the periodic routine health examination provides an operable environment for implementing pulse vaccination in China. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the theoretical results and help to design the final mixed vaccination strategy once the new vaccine comes out.},

The result shows that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable if R-0 {\textless}= 1, and is unstable if R-0 {\textgreater} 1. When R-0 {\textgreater} 1, there also exists a locally asymptotically stable endemic equilibrium. Simulations confirm the analysis, and exhibit that undetected TB cases play an important role.},

abstract = {Adjusting for a causal intermediate is a common analytic strategy for estimating an average causal direct effect (ACDE). The ACDE is the component of the total exposure effect that is not relayed through the specified intermediate. Even if the total effect is unconfounded, the usual ACDE estimate may be biased when an unmeasured variable affects the intermediate and outcome variables. Using linear programming optimization to compute non-parametric bounds, we develop new ACDE estimators for binary measured variables in this causal structure, and use root mean square confounding bias (RMSB) to compare their performance with the usual stratified estimator in simulated distributions of target populations comprised of the 64 possible potential response types as well as distributions of target populations restricted to subsets of 18 or 12 potential response types defined by monotonicity or no-interactions assumptions of unit-level causal effects. We also consider target population distributions conditioned on fixed outcome risk among the unexposed, or fixed true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate. Results show that a midpoint estimator constructed from the optimization bounds has consistently lower RMSB than the usual stratified estimator both unconditionally and conditioned on any risk in the unexposed. When conditioning on true ACDE, this midpoint estimator performs more poorly only when conditioned on an extreme true ACDE in one stratum of the intermediate, yet outperforms the stratified estimator in the other stratum when interaction is permitted. An alternate 'limit-modified crude' estimator can never perform less favourably than the stratified estimator, and often has lower RMSB.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION: The potential cost-effectiveness of screening depends on the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in the population being screened and the rate at which the screening outcome (prevention) is achieved. AIMS: To compare the cost-effectiveness of contact screening for TB for: (1) contact screening as it actually occurred in Victoria in 1991 (Model 1); (2) the process which should have occurred had the 1991 contact screening guidelines been followed (Model 2); (3) a hypothetical evidence-based model (Model 3). METHODS: Three models were constructed according to the aims. The cost-effectiveness of contact screening is presented as costs to government per unit outcome (in the form of cases prevented, cases found and contacts traced) for each model. Assumptions about disease behaviour were consistent between models. A sensitivity analysis was performed to examine the effect of the assumptions made in Model 3 about rates of referral and treatment of infected contacts, and about the efficacy of isoniazid (INH) in preventing TB. RESULTS: The total cost of Model 1 was greater than that of the other Models. Model 1 is the least cost-effective, costing {\$}309 065 per case prevented, and Model 3 is the most cost-effective, costing {\$}32 210 per case prevented. The cost of Model 2 was {\$}58 742 per case prevented. The incremental cost-effectiveness of Model 3 compared to Model 2 is {\$}107 per additional contact screened, and {\$}3881 per additional case prevented. Case finding is not as cost-effective as best-practice case prevention, ranging from {\$}231 799 per case found in Model 1 to {\$}205 596 per case found in Model 2. The sensitivity analysis shows that the cost-effectiveness of Model 3 decreases with lower referral rates, lower rates of preventive therapy, and lower efficacy of INH. However, even allowing for reduced programme parameters, Model 3 is most cost-effective. DISCUSSION: Costing policy options is an important component of programme delivery, but needs to be considered in the context of the product being purchased, e.g. the prevention of disease, or case finding. Case finding as a product of contact screening is expensive in all three models. Prevention of TB, on the other hand, can be cost-effective, as shown in Model 3. It was least cost-effective in Model 1, largely because prevention was not considered a priority, and few infected contacts actually received preventive therapy. Clear programme aims, adherence to guidelines and high rates of preventive therapy are essential in order to achieve cost-effectiveness.},

abstract = {Over the past few years there have been an increasing number of research articles published in Thorax on respiratory tract infections (including tuberculosis) affecting children and adults. Although these articles cover a wide variety of areas, several broad themes can be discerned. These include greater interest in viral respiratory infections (partially stimulated by the recent influenza A pandemic), improved characterisation of who is at risk of community-acquired pneumonia and mycobacterial infection, research into better diagnostics and attempts to develop new or improved scoring scales for a range of respiratory infection syndromes. There have also been a limited number of articles on how to manage patients with respiratory infection, including describing the efficacy of prevention by vaccination. Overall, there has been a discernible emphasis on transferring advances in clinical science to actual clinical practice, with several papers using molecular methodologies or measuring levels of cytokines or other potential biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with lung infection. There have also been manuscripts linking specific pathogen genotypes to infection phenotype, an area that is likely to be increasingly important in explaining some of the variations in severity between patients with respiratory infection. However, many questions remain on the optimum strategies for the management and prevention of pneumonia, bronchiectasis and tuberculosis, and there remains a strong need for further clinical research in order to make substantial improvements in the management of patients with lung infection.},

@article{Moreno2017,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The transmission dynamics of Tuberculosis (TB) involve complex epidemiological and socio-economical interactions between individuals living in highly distinct regional conditions. The level of exogenous reinfection and first time infection rates within high-incidence settings may influence the impact of control programs on TB prevalence. The impact that effective population size and the distribution of individuals' residence times in different patches have on TB transmission and control are studied using selected scenarios where risk is defined by the estimated or perceive first time infection and/or exogenous re-infection rates. METHODS: This study aims at enhancing the understanding of TB dynamics, within simplified, two patch, risk-defined environments, in the presence of short term mobility and variations in reinfection and infection rates via a mathematical model. The modeling framework captures the role of individuals' 'daily' dynamics within and between places of residency, work or business via the average proportion of time spent in residence and as visitors to TB-risk environments (patches). As a result, the effective population size of Patch i (home of i-residents) at time t must account for visitors and residents of Patch i, at time t. RESULTS: The study identifies critical social behaviors mechanisms that can facilitate or eliminate TB infection in vulnerable populations. The results suggest that short-term mobility between heterogeneous patches contributes to significant overall increases in TB prevalence when risk is considered only in terms of direct new infection transmission, compared to the effect of exogenous reinfection. Although, the role of exogenous reinfection increases the risk that come from large movement of individuals, due to catastrophes or conflict, to TB-free areas. CONCLUSIONS: The study highlights that allowing infected individuals to move from high to low TB prevalence areas (for example via the sharing of treatment and isolation facilities) may lead to a reduction in the total TB prevalence in the overall population. The higher the population size heterogeneity between distinct risk patches, the larger the benefit (low overall prevalence) under the same "traveling" patterns. Policies need to account for population specific factors (such as risks that are inherent with high levels of migration, local and regional mobility patterns, and first time infection rates) in order to be long lasting, effective and results in low number of drug resistant cases.},

The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex. Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major effect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Extensively drug-resistant (XDR) tuberculosis has spread among hospitalised patients in South Africa, but the epidemic-level effect of hospital-based infection control strategies remains unknown. We modelled the plausible effect of rapidly available infection control strategies on the overall course of the XDR tuberculosis epidemic in a rural area of South Africa. METHODS: We investigated the effect of administrative, environmental, and personal infection control measures on the epidemic trajectory of XDR tuberculosis in the rural community of Tugela Ferry. Assessments were done with a mathematical model incorporating over 2 years of longitudinal inpatient and community-based data. The model simulated inpatient airborne tuberculosis transmission, community tuberculosis transmission, and the effect of HIV and antiretroviral therapy. FINDINGS: If no new interventions are introduced, about 1300 cases of XDR tuberculosis are predicted to occur in the area of Tugela Ferry by the end of 2012, more than half of which are likely to be nosocomially transmitted. Mask use alone would avert fewer than 10{\%} of cases in the overall epidemic, but could prevent a large proportion of cases of XDR tuberculosis in hospital staff. The combination of mask use with reduced hospitalisation time and a shift to outpatient therapy could prevent nearly a third of XDR tuberculosis cases. Supplementing this approach with improved ventilation, rapid drug resistance testing, HIV treatment, and tuberculosis isolation facilities could avert 48{\%} of XDR tuberculosis cases (range 34-50{\%}) by the end of 2012. However, involuntary detention could result in an unexpected rise in incidence due to restricted isolation capacity. INTERPRETATION: A synergistic combination of available nosocomial infection control strategies could prevent nearly half of XDR tuberculosis cases, even in a resource-limited setting. XDR tuberculosis transmission will probably continue in the community, indicating the need to develop and implement parallel community-based programmes.},

abstract = {Background: In sub-Saharan Africa, patients with advanced HIV experience high mortality during the first few months of antiretroviral therapy (ART), largely attributable to tuberculosis (TB). We evaluated the cost-effectiveness of TB diagnostic strategies to reduce this early mortality. Methods: We developed a decision analytic model to estimate the incremental cost, deaths averted, and cost-effectiveness of 3 TB diagnostic algorithms. The model base case represents current practice (symptoms screening, sputum smear, and chest radiography) in many resource-limited countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We compared the current practice with World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended practice with culture and WHO-recommended practice with the Xpert mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampicin test and considered relevant medical costs from a health system perspective using the timeframe of the first 6 months of ART. We conducted univariate and probabilistic sensitivity analyses on all parameters in the model. Results: When considering TB diagnosis and treatment and ART costs, the cost per patient was {\$}850 for current practice, {\$}809 for the algorithm with Xpert test, and {\$}879 for the algorithm with culture. Our results showed that both WHO-recommended algorithms avert more deaths among TB cases than does the current practice. The algorithm with Xpert test was least costly at reducing early mortality compared with the current practice. Sensitivity analyses indicated that cost-effectiveness findings were stable. Conclusions: Our analysis showed that culture or Xpert were cost-effective at reducing early mortality during the first 6 months of ART compared with the current practice. Thus, our findings provide support for ongoing efforts to expand TB diagnostic capacity.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Drug resistance poses a serious challenge for the control of tuberculosis in many settings. It is well established that the expected future trend in resistance depends on the reproductive fitness of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. However, the variability in fitness between strains with different resistance-conferring mutations has been largely ignored when making these predictions. METHODS: We developed a novel approach for incorporating the variable fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations and for tracking this distribution of fitness costs over time within a transmission model. We used this approach to describe the effects of realistic fitness cost distributions on the future prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis. RESULTS: The shape of the distribution of fitness costs was a strong predictor of the long-term prevalence of resistance. While, as expected, lower average fitness costs of drug resistance-conferring mutations were associated with more severe epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis, fitness distributions with greater variance also led to higher levels of drug resistance. For example, compared to simulations in which the fitness cost of resistance was fixed, introducing a realistic amount of variance resulted in a 40{\%} increase in prevalence of drug-resistant tuberculosis after 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: The differences in the fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations are a key determinant of the future burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Future studies that can better establish the range of fitness costs associated with drug resistance-conferring mutations will improve projections and thus facilitate better public health planning efforts.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the transmission models of tuberculosis in heterogeneous population. DATA SOURCES: The data used in this review were adopted mainly from the studies of models of tuberculosis reported from 1995 to 2006. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant literature on transmission models of tuberculosis in heterogeneous populations are referenced. RESULTS: Casual/random factors and genetic factors are the main reasons for epidemics of tuberculosis in recent years. Mass public transport is playing the primary role in casually close contact which can facilitate the transmission of tuberculosis. Genetic susceptibility not only varies endemic prevalence levels, but also drastically alters the effects of treatment for tuberculosis patients. Detailed studies further exhibit that casual contact and genetic factor are responsible for over 30{\%} - 40{\%} of the total new cases in recent years. The prevalence of tuberculosis could double (from 33{\%} to 60{\%}) if a genetically susceptible phenotype is present in only 30{\%} of the population. And some challenges have emerged along with these exciting results. CONCLUSIONS: Casual/random contact, public transport and genetic susceptibility are responsible for most new tuberculosis cases and a wide variation in endemic tuberculosis levels between regions. Hence, the transmission model of tuberculosis in a heterogeneous population can provide more clues to underlying mechanism of tuberculosis transmission than in a homogeneous population. However, many challenges remain for us in understanding transmission of disease.},

abstract = {In any setting, a proportion of incident active tuberculosis (TB) reflects recent transmission ("recent transmission proportion"), whereas the remainder represents reactivation. Appropriately estimating the recent transmission proportion has important implications for local TB control, but existing approaches have known biases, especially where data are incomplete. We constructed a stochastic individual-based model of a TB epidemic and designed a set of simulations (derivation set) to develop two regression-based tools for estimating the recent transmission proportion from five inputs: underlying TB incidence, sampling coverage, study duration, clustered proportion of observed cases, and proportion of observed clusters in the sample. We tested these tools on a set of unrelated simulations (validation set), and compared their performance against that of the traditional 'n-1' approach. In the validation set, the regression tools reduced the absolute estimation bias (difference between estimated and true recent transmission proportion) in the 'n-1' technique by a median [interquartile range] of 60{\%} [9{\%}, 82{\%}] and 69{\%} [30{\%}, 87{\%}]. The bias in the 'n-1' model was highly sensitive to underlying levels of study coverage and duration, and substantially underestimated the recent transmission proportion in settings of incomplete data coverage. By contrast, the regression models' performance was more consistent across different epidemiological settings and study characteristics. We provide one of these regression models as a user-friendly, web-based tool. Novel tools can improve our ability to estimate the recent TB transmission proportion from data that are observable (or estimable) by public health practitioners with limited available molecular data.},

DESIGN: A spreadsheet model incorporating variables drawn from published studies and unpublished data. SUBJECTS: Data drawn from a number of different studies and published literature involving a range of subjects. SETTING: Zambia. RESULTS: Using data primarily from Zambia we have modelled the costs and benefits of a TB preventive therapy programme using daily isoniazid for 6 months. The basecase scenario assumes recruitment at a voluntary testing and counselling site where HIV seroprevalence is 30{\%}; persons with HIV have a 25{\%} probability of developing active TB during their lifetime; two additional cases of TB would be prevented per person completing a course of preventive therapy; compliance would be 63{\%}, and the efficacy of the isoniazid in preventing active TB of 60{\%}. The costs under this scenario would exceed the benefits by a factor of 1.16 [benefit: cost ratio (BCR) of 0.86]. However, if preventing one case of TB prevented an additional five cases, the benefits would exceed the costs by a significant margin (BCR of 1.71). Other scenarios indicate that the targeted preventive therapy of persons with HIV whose occupation or living situation places them in contact with a large number of others (teachers and students, health personnel, military and police, miners, prisoners, etc.) would yield significant net benefit. The operational challenge for TB preventive therapy is thus to identify and target large numbers of such persons.},

The definition of magnitude is a special case of a general categorical definition that clarifies the analogies between various cardinality-like invariants in mathematics. Although this motivation is a world away from geometric measure, magnitude, when applied to subsets of R{\^{}}n, turns out to be intimately related to invariants such as volume, surface area, perimeter and dimension. We describe several aspects of this relationship, providing evidence for a conjecture (first stated in arXiv:0908.1582) that magnitude subsumes all the most important invariants of classical integral geometry.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis is a worldwide health problem with 2 billion people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the bacteria causing TB). The hallmark of infection is the emergence of organized structures of immune cells forming primarily in the lung in response to infection. Granulomas physically contain and immunologically restrain bacteria that cannot be cleared. We have developed several models that spatially characterize the dynamics of the host-mycobacterial interaction, and identified mechanisms that control granuloma formation and development. In particular, we published several agent-based models (ABMs) of granuloma formation in TB that include many subtypes of T cell populations, macrophages as well as key cytokine and chemokine effector molecules. These ABM studies emphasize the important role of T-cell related mechanisms in infection progression, such as magnitude and timing of T cell recruitment, and macrophage activation. In these models, the priming and recruitment of T cells from the lung draining lymph node (LN) was captured phenomenologically. In addition to these ABM studies, we have also developed several multi-organ models using ODEs to examine trafficking of cells between, for example, the lung and LN. While we can predict temporal dynamic behaviors, those models are not coupled to the spatial aspects of granuloma. To this end, we have developed a multi-organ model that is hybrid: an ABM for the lung compartment and a non-linear system of ODE representing the lymph node compartment. This hybrid multi-organ approach to study TB granuloma formation in the lung and immune priming in the LN allows us to dissect protective mechanisms that cannot be achieved using the single compartment or multi-compartment ODE system. The main finding of this work is that trafficking of important cells known as antigen presenting cells from the lung to the lymph node is a key control mechanism for protective immunity: the entire spectrum of infection outcomes can be regulated by key immune cell migration rates. Our hybrid multi-organ implementation suggests that effector CD4+ T cells can rescue the system from a persistent infection and lead to clearance once a granuloma is fully formed. This could be effective as an immunotherapy strategy for latently infected individuals. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {HIV transmission models have become very complex. The behavior of some of these models may only be explored by uncertainty and sensitivity analyses, because the structural complexity of the model are coupled with a high degree of uncertainty in estimating the values of the input parameters. Uncertainty analysis may be used to assess the variability (prediction imprecision) in the outcome variable that is due to the uncertainty in estimating the input values. A sensitivity analysis can extend an uncertainty analysis by identifying which parameters are important in contributing to the prediction imprecision (i.e., how do changes in the values of the input parameters alter the value of the outcome variable). In this paper an uncertainty and a sensitivity analysis are described and applied; both analyses are based upon the Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS) scheme, which is an extremely efficient sampling design proposed by McKay, Conover {\&} Beckman (1979). The methods described in this paper have not previously been applied to deterministic models of disease transmission, although these models have many characteristics in common with the risk assessment models that the strategies were designed to investigate. The utility of the LHS uncertainty and the LHS/PRC (Latin Hypercube Sampling/Partial Rank Correlation) sensitivity analysis techniques are illustrated by analyzing a complex deterministic model of HIV transmission.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The optimal treatment for latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis infection remains unclear. In anticipation of future clinical trials, we modeled the expected performance of six potential regimens for treatment of latent multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis. METHODS: A computerized Markov model to analyze the total cost of treatment for six different regimens: Pyrazinamide/ethambutol, moxifloxacin monotherapy, moxifloxacin/pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin/ethambutol, moxifloxacin/ethionamide, and moxifloxacin/PA-824. Efficacy estimates were extrapolated from mouse models and examined over a wide range of assumptions. RESULTS: In the base-case, moxifloxacin monotherapy was the lowest cost strategy, but moxifloxacin/ethambutol was cost-effective at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of {\$}21,252 per quality-adjusted life-year. Both pyrazinamide-containing regimens were dominated due to their toxicity. A hypothetical regimen of low toxicity and even modest efficacy was cost-effective compared to "no treatment." CONCLUSION: In our model, moxifloxacin/ethambutol was the preferred treatment strategy under a wide range of assumptions; pyrazinamide-containing regimens fared poorly because of high rates of toxicity. Although more data are needed on efficacy of treatments for latent MDR-TB infection, data on toxicity and treatment discontinuation, which are easier to obtain, could have a substantial impact on public health practice.},

We systematically searched published material for studies using DNA fingerprinting to provide data on the issue. Very few studies were designed for that particular research objective and/or report on a sufficient number of observations. Differences in methods - eg, case-definitions - seriously hamper comparisons between studies. The proportion of recurrences due to reinfection ranged between 0{\%} and 100{\%}; however, this figure cannot be a useful indicator since the two causes of recurrence - relapse and reinfection - are essentially independent. Only one study provides an estimate of the incidence of recurrence due to reinfection, indicating its importance for HIV-infected patients in an environment with an unusually high tuberculosis incidence. We argue that apart from extreme situations like this one the problem of recurrence of tuberculosis due to reinfection has few implications for tuberculosis-control programmes.},

abstract = {The problems of management of tuberculosis in developing nations are studied utilizing the tools of systems analysis. The tuberculosis system consists of interacting components which are the “states of nature” of the disease. The interaction of these components determine the future state of the disease. Controls in the form of therapy, vaccinations or prophylaxis may be superimposed on the natural processes, thus altering the future course of the disease. A descriptive mathematical model describing the flows between the various categories is used to predict the trends both with and without intervention. An optimization model is derived from the descriptive model under the assumption that a program of reduction of active cases has been specified. The optimization model selects the forms of control which achieve the specified reduction program at least cost. Optimization is accomplished via linear programming. The model is general in that the parameters, costs and initial conditions may be varied for different situations. The descriptive mathematical model and the optimization model which determines the most efficient controls are intended to improve decision-making in public health management of tuberculosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the Three I's for HIV/TB (human immunodeficiency virus/tuberculosis): antiretroviral therapy (ART), intensified TB case finding (ICF), isoniazid preventive treatment (IPT), and TB infection control (IC). METHODS: Using a 3-year decision-analytic model, we estimated the cost-effectiveness of a base scenario (55{\%} ART coverage at CD4 count 350 cells/mm(3)) and 19 strategies that included one or more of the following: 1) 90{\%} ART coverage, 2) IC and 3) ICF using four-symptom screening and 6- or 36-month IPT. The TB diagnostic algorithm included 1) sputum smear microscopy with chest X-ray, and 2) Xpert(R) MTB/RIF. RESULTS: In resource-constrained settings with a high burden of HIV and TB, the most cost-effective strategies under both diagnostic algorithms included 1) 55{\%} ART coverage and IC, 2) 55{\%} ART coverage, IC and 36-month IPT, and 3) expanded ART at 90{\%} coverage with IC and 36-month IPT. The latter averted more TB cases than other scenarios with increased ART coverage, IC, 6-month IPT and/or IPT for tuberculin skin test positive individuals. The cost-effectiveness results did not change significantly under the sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: Expanded ART to 90{\%} coverage, IC and a 36-month IPT strategy averted most TB cases and is among the cost-effective strategies.},

abstract = {This study examined whether costs associated with tuberculosis (TB) screening and directly observed preventive therapy (DOPT) among drug injectors attending a syringe exchange are justified by cases and costs of active TB cases prevented and examined the impact of monetary incentives to promote adherence on cost-effectiveness. We examined program costs and projected savings using observed adherence and prevalence rates and literature estimates of isoniazid (INH) preventive therapy efficacy, expected INH hepatoxicity rates, and TB treatment costs; we conducted sensitivity analyses for a range of INH effectiveness, chest X-ray (CXR) referral adherence, and different strategies regarding anergy among persons affected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For 1,000 patients offered screening, incorporating real observed program adherence rates, the program would avert {\$}179,934 in TB treatment costs, for a net savings of {\$}123,081. Assuming a modest risk of TB among HIV-infected anergic persons, all strategies with regard to anergy were cost saving, and the strategy of not screening for anergy and not providing DOPT to HIV-infected anergic persons resulted in the greatest cost savings. If an incentive of {\$}25 per person increased CXR adherence from the observed 31{\%} to 50{\%} or 100{\%}, over a 5-year follow-up the net cost savings would increase to {\$}170,054 and {\$}414,856, respectively. In this model, TB screening and DOPT at a syringe exchange is a cost-effective intervention and is cost-saving compared to costs of treating active TB cases that would have occurred in the absence of the intervention. This model is useful in evaluating the cost impact of planned program refinements, which can then be tested. Monetary incentives for those referred for screening CXRs would be justified on a cost basis if they had even a modest beneficial impact on adherence.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Household contact tracing has recently been endorsed for global tuberculosis (TB) control, but its potential population-level impact remains uncertain. OBJECTIVES: To project the maximum impact of household contact tracing for TB in a moderate-burden setting. METHODS: We developed a stochastic, agent-based simulation model of a simplified TB epidemic, calibrated to a setting of moderate TB incidence. We used data from the literature to generate "community-driven" and "household-driven" scenarios in which 22 and 50{\%} of TB transmission occurred within the household, respectively. In each scenario, we simulated an intervention in which the household members are screened and treated for TB at the time of an index patient's active TB diagnosis. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: By the time of TB diagnosis, 75 to 95{\%} of initial household infections had already occurred, but only 1.5 to 3.0{\%} of contacts had sufficient time to progress to active TB. With 100{\%} sensitive tracing of all contacts for 5 consecutive years, TB incidence declined by 10 to 15{\%}, with a mean year-over-year decline of 2{\%} per year. Effects were sustained for many years after stopping the intervention. Providing preventive therapy with contact tracing nearly doubled this impact (17-27{\%} decline in incidence). Impact was proportional to sensitivity and coverage; thus, if 50{\%} of contacts were screened with a 50{\%} sensitive test, TB incidence declined by only 0.5{\%} per year. CONCLUSIONS: Household contact tracing is unlikely to transform TB epidemiology in isolation but has the potential, especially with provision of preventive therapy, to augment a comprehensive package of interventions that could substantially reduce the population-level burden of TB.},

abstract = {The efficacy of vaccines is typically estimated prior to implementation, on the basis of randomized controlled trials. This does not preclude, however, subsequent assessment post-licensure, while mass-immunization and nonlinear transmission feedbacks are in place. In this paper we show how cross-sectional prevalence data post-vaccination can be interpreted in terms of pathogen transmission processes and vaccine parameters, using a dynamic epidemiological model. We advocate the use of such frameworks for model-based vaccine evaluation in the field, fitting trajectories of cross-sectional prevalence of pathogen strains before and after intervention. Using SI and SIS models, we illustrate how prevalence ratios in vaccinated and non-vaccinated hosts depend on true vaccine efficacy, the absolute and relative strength of competition between target and non-target strains, the time post follow-up, and transmission intensity. We argue that a mechanistic approach should be added to vaccine efficacy estimation against multi-type pathogens, because it naturally accounts for inter-strain competition and indirect effects, leading to a robust measure of individual protection per contact. Our study calls for systematic attention to epidemiological feedbacks when interpreting population level impact. At a broader level, our parameter estimation procedure provides a promising proof of principle for a generalizable framework to infer vaccine efficacy post-licensure.},

Now HIV threatens control of TB in Asia, Eastern Europe, and Latin America.

@article{Gomes2004,
abstract = {Population patterns of infection are determined largely by susceptibility to infection. Infection and vaccination induce an immune response that, typically, reduces susceptibility to subsequent infections. With a general epidemic model, we detect a 'reinfection threshold', above which reinfection is the principal type of transmission and, consequently, infection levels are much higher and vaccination fails. The model is further developed to address human tuberculosis (TB) and the impact of vaccination. The bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) is the only vaccine in current use against TB, and there is no consensus about its usefulness. Estimates of protection range from 0 to 80{\%}, and this variability is aggravated by an association between low vaccine efficacy and high prevalence of the disease. We propose an explanation based on three postulates: (i) the potential for transmission varies between populations, owing to differences in socio-economic and environmental factors; (ii) exposure to mycobacteria induces an immune response that is partially protective against reinfection; and (iii) this protection is not significantly improved by BCG vaccination. These postulates combine to reproduce the observed trends, and this is attributed to a reinfection threshold intrinsic to the transmission dynamics. Finally, we demonstrate how reinfection thresholds can be manipulated by vaccination programmes, suggesting that they have a potentially powerful role in global control.},

abstract = {About 90{\%} of the people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis carry latent bacteria that are believed to get activated upon immune suppression. One of the fundamental challenges in the control of tuberculosis is therefore to understand molecular mechanisms involved in the onset of latency and/or reactivation. We have attempted to address this problem at the systems level by a combination of predicted functional protein:protein interactions, integration of functional interactions with large scale gene expression studies, predicted transcription regulatory network and finally simulations with a boolean model of the network. Initially a prediction for genome-wide protein functional linkages was obtained based on genome-context methods using a Support Vector Machine. This set of protein functional linkages along with gene expression data of the available models of latency was employed to identify proteins involved in mediating switch signals during dormancy. We show that genes that are up and down regulated during dormancy are not only coordinately regulated under dormancy-like conditions but also under a variety of other experimental conditions. Their synchronized regulation indicates that they form a tightly regulated gene cluster and might form a latency-regulon. Conservation of these genes across bacterial species suggests a unique evolutionary history that might be associated with M. tuberculosis dormancy. Finally, simulations with a boolean model based on the regulatory network with logical relationships derived from gene expression data reveals a bistable switch suggesting alternating latent and actively growing states. Our analysis based on the interaction network therefore reveals a potential model of M. tuberculosis latency.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the cost-utility of microscopic observation drug-susceptibility assay (MODS) and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF implementation for tuberculosis (TB) diagnosis in rural northern Mozambique. METHODS: Stochastic transmission compartmental TB model from the healthcare provider perspective with parameter input from direct measurements, systematic literature reviews and expert opinion. MODS and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF were evaluated as replacement test of smear microscopy (SM) or as an add-on test after a negative SM. Costs were calculated in 2013 USD, effects in disability-adjusted life years (DALY). Willingness to pay threshold (WPT) was established at once the per capita Gross National Income of Mozambique. RESULTS: MODS as an add-on test to negative SM produced an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of 5647.89USD/DALY averted. MODS as a substitute for SM yielded an ICER of 5374.58USD/DALY averted. Xpert(R) MTB/RIF as an add-on test to negative SM yielded ICER of 345.71USD/DALY averted. Xpert(R) MTB/RIF as a substitute for SM obtained an ICER of 122.13USD/DALY averted. TB prevalence and risk of infection were the main factors impacting MODS and Xpert(R) MTB/RIF ICER in the one-way sensitivity analysis. In the probabilistic sensitivity analysis, Xpert(R) MTB/RIF was most likely to have an ICER below the WPT, whereas MODS was not. CONCLUSION: Our cost-utility analysis favours the implementation of Xpert(R) MTB/RIF as a replacement of SM for all TB suspects in this rural high TB/HIV prevalence African setting.},

abstract = {STUDY OBJECTIVES: To compare the costs and effectiveness of directly observed therapy (DOT) vs self-administered therapy (SAT) for the treatment of active tuberculosis. DESIGN: Decision analysis. SETTING: We used published rates for failure of therapy, relapse, and acquired multidrug resistance during the initial treatment of drug-susceptible tuberculosis cases using DOT or SAT. We estimated costs of tuberculosis treatment at an urban tuberculosis control program, a municipal hospital, and a hospital specializing in treating drug-resistant tuberculosis. OUTCOME MEASURES: The average cost per patient to cure drug-susceptible tuberculosis, including the cost of treating failures of initial treatment. RESULTS: The direct costs of initial therapy with DOT and SAT were similar ({\$}1,206 vs {\$}1,221 per patient, respectively), although DOT was more expensive when patient time costs were included. When the costs of relapse and failure were included in the model, DOT was less expensive than SAT, whether considering outpatient costs only ({\$}1,405 vs {\$}2,314 per patient treated), outpatient plus inpatient costs ({\$}2,785 vs {\$}10,529 per patient treated), or outpatient, inpatient, and patients' time costs ({\$}3,999 vs {\$}12,167 per patient treated). Threshold analysis demonstrated that DOT was less expensive than SAT through a wide range of cost estimates and clinical event rates. CONCLUSION: Despite its greater initial cost, DOT is a more cost-effective strategy than SAT because it achieves a higher cure rate after initial therapy, and thereby decreases treatment costs associated with failure of therapy and acquired drug resistance. This cost-effectiveness analysis supports the widespread implementation of DOT.},

Yet in practice, most Bayesian analyses are performed with so-called "noninformative" priors, that is, priors constructed by some formal rule. We review the plethora of techniques for constructing such priors and discuss some of the practical and philosophical issues that arise when they are used. We give special emphasis to Jeffreys's rules and discuss the evolution of his viewpoint about the interpretation of priors, away from unique representation of ignorance toward the notion that they should be chosen by convention. We conclude that the problems raised by the research on priors chosen by formal rules are serious and may not be dismissed lightly: When sample sizes are small (relative to the number of parameters being estimated), it is dangerous to put faith in any "default" solution; but when asymptotics take over, Jeffreys's rules and their variants remain reasonable choices.

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is a widely diffused infection. However, in general, the human immune system is able to contain it. In this work, we propose a mathematical model which describes the early immune response to the Mtb infection in the lungs, also including the possible evolution of the infection in the formation of a granuloma. The model is based on coupled reaction-diffusion-transport equations with chemotaxis, which take into account the interactions among bacteria, macrophages and chemoattractant. The novelty of this approach is in the modeling of the velocity field, proportional to the gradient of the pressure developed between the cells, which makes possible to deal with a full multidimensional description and efficient numerical simulations. We perform a linear stability analysis of the model and propose a robust implicit-explicit scheme to deal with long time simulations. Both in one and two-dimensions, we find that there are threshold values in the parameters space, between a contained infection and the uncontrolled bacteria growth, and the generation of granuloma-like patterns can be observed numerically.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign-born persons in Canada contribute 67{\%} of all tuberculosis (TB) cases annually, but represent only 21{\%} of the total population. Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that most foreign-born TB cases result from the reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the effect on incidence of a prevention strategy that would screen selected immigrants at arrival for LTBI and offer preventive treatment to those who test positive. DESIGN: A deterministic model was developed to quantify the incidence of active TB in immigrants to Canada and validated with national immigration and TB case data. RESULTS: Model simulations suggested that it would be optimal to screen and treat LTBI in new immigrants from countries of birth with an estimated TB incidence rate in excess of 50 per 100 000 person-years. If this strategy had been implemented in 1986, the national TB incidence rate would have fallen by 18.5{\%}, from 5.4 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 population by 2002. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that screening and treating LTBI in foreign-born persons from high TB incidence countries is the most effective strategy in terms of total persons screened and treated and percentage reduction in national incidence.},

abstract = {Different combinations of coverage levels of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment may achieve the same problem reduction in epidemiological terms. But the same problem reduction, in man-years of tuberculosis, may be valued differently in social terms.A social-time-preference parameter, of the form 1/(1+r)(t), is relevant to this evaluation and the level of r is critical for policy decision. The present paper studies the sensitivity of the effectiveness of BCG vaccination and of case-finding and treatment to the level of r, and the epidemiological mechanism underlying such sensitivity. A high value of r can be visualized as corresponding to a close planning horizon, a lower value of r to a more distant one. At any level of epidemiological effectiveness, a planner with a high value of r would favour case-finding and treatment, and a planner with a low value of r would tend to emphasize BCG vaccination. This influence of the social-time-preference parameter on the planner's decision is found to depend on the discounting effect of the parameter on the one hand, and on the different age- and time-patterns of the preventive effect of the major control measures, on the other.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Numerous patient and healthcare system-related delays contribute to the overall delay experienced by patients from onset of TB symptoms to diagnosis and treatment. Such delays are critical as infected individuals remain untreated in the community, providing more opportunities for transmission of the disease and adversely affecting the epidemic. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We present an analysis of the factors that contribute to the overall delay in TB diagnosis and treatment, in a resource-poor setting. Impact on the distribution of diagnostic delay times was assessed for various factors, the sensitivity of the diagnostic method being found to be the most significant. A linear relationship was found between the sensitivity of the test and the predicted mean delay time, with an increase in test sensitivity resulting in a reduced mean delay time and a reduction in the drop-out rate. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results show that in a developing country a number of delay factors, particularly the low sensitivity of the initial sputum smear microscopy test, potentially increase total diagnostic delay times experienced by TB patients significantly. The results reinforce the urgent need for novel diagnostic methods, both for smear positive and negative TB, that are highly sensitive, accessible and point of care, in order to reduce mean delay times.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73{\%}. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective. However, the low number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated severe TB cases leads to broad confidence intervals on vaccine efficacy, highlighting the difficulty associated with decision-making in low-prevalence settings.},

Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible.

The model considers both TB and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) treatment for individuals with only one of the two infectious diseases or both. The basic reproduction number and equilibrium points are determined and stability is analyzed. Through simulations, we show that TB treatment for individuals with only TB infection reduces the number of individuals that become coinfected with TB and HIV/AIDS and reduces the diseases (TB and AIDS) induced deaths. Analogously, the treatment of individuals with only AIDS also reduces the number of coinfected individuals. Further, TB treatment for coinfected individuals in the active and latent stage of TB disease implies a decrease of the number of individuals that passes from HIV-positive to AIDS.},

abstract = {This paper describes an action framework for countries with low tuberculosis (TB) incidence ({\textless}100 TB cases per million population) that are striving for TB elimination. The framework sets out priority interventions required for these countries to progress first towards "pre-elimination" ({\textless}10 cases per million) and eventually the elimination of TB as a public health problem (less than one case per million). TB epidemiology in most low-incidence countries is characterised by a low rate of transmission in the general population, occasional outbreaks, a majority of TB cases generated from progression of latent TB infection (LTBI) rather than local transmission, concentration to certain vulnerable and hard-to-reach risk groups, and challenges posed by cross-border migration. Common health system challenges are that political commitment, funding, clinical expertise and general awareness of TB diminishes as TB incidence falls. The framework presents a tailored response to these challenges, grouped into eight priority action areas: 1) ensure political commitment, funding and stewardship for planning and essential services; 2) address the most vulnerable and hard-to-reach groups; 3) address special needs of migrants and cross-border issues; 4) undertake screening for active TB and LTBI in TB contacts and selected high-risk groups, and provide appropriate treatment; 5) optimise the prevention and care of drug-resistant TB; 6) ensure continued surveillance, programme monitoring and evaluation and case-based data management; 7) invest in research and new tools; and 8) support global TB prevention, care and control. The overall approach needs to be multisectorial, focusing on equitable access to high-quality diagnosis and care, and on addressing the social determinants of TB. Because of increasing globalisation and population mobility, the response needs to have both national and global dimensions.},

@article{Uys2009a,
abstract = {In a significant number of instances, an episode of tuberculosis can be attributed to a reinfection event. Because reinfection is more likely in high incidence regions than in regions of low incidence, more tuberculosis (TB) cases due to reinfection could be expected in high-incidence regions than in low-incidence regions. Empirical data from regions with various incidence rates appear to confirm the conjecture that, in fact, the incidence rate due to reinfection only, as a proportion of all cases, correlates with the logarithm of the incidence rate, rather than with the incidence rate itself. A theoretical model that supports this conjecture is presented. A Markov model was used to obtain a relationship between incidence and reinfection rates. It was assumed in this model that the rate of reinfection is a multiple, rho (the reinfection factor), of the rate of first-time infection, lambda. The results obtained show a relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the rate of incidence that is approximately logarithmic for a range of values of the incidence rate typical of those observed in communities across the globe. A value of rho is determined such that the relationship between the proportion of cases due to reinfection and the logarithm of the incidence rate closely correlates with empirical data. From a purely theoretical investigation, it is shown that a simple relationship can be expected between the logarithm of the incidence rates and the proportions of cases due to reinfection after a prior episode of TB. This relationship is sustained by a rate of reinfection that is higher than the rate of first-time infection and this latter consideration underscores the great importance of monitoring recovered TB cases for repeat disease episodes, especially in regions where TB incidence is high. Awareness of this may assist in attempts to control the epidemic.},

We conducted a systematic review of mathematical models estimating the epidemiological impact of future human TB vaccines.

An adapted quality assessment tool was developed, with a resulting median study quality score of 20/28. The literature remains divided as to whether vaccines effective pre- or post-infection would provide greatest epidemiological impact. However, all-age or adolescent/adult targeted prevention of disease vaccines achieve greater and more rapid impact than neonatal vaccines. Mass campaigns alongside routine neonatal vaccination can have profound additional impact. Economic evaluations found TB vaccines overwhelmingly cost-effective, particularly when targeted to adolescents/adults. The variability of impact by setting, age group and vaccine characteristics must be accounted for in the development and delivery of future TB vaccines.},

We investigate the effect of HIV on TB TO using a multilevel and a multinomial logistic models, and considering the interaction between HIV and multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB. RESULTS: A total of 61138 TB cases including 5.5{\%} HIV-positive were eligible for our analysis. In the multilevel model adjusted for age and an interaction with MDR-TB, HIV was significantly associated with lower treatment success in all MDR strata [Non-MDR-TB: odds ratio (OR) 0.24 CI 0.20-0.29; Unknown MDR-TB status: OR 0.26 CI 0.23-0.30; MDR-TB: OR 0.57 CI 0.35-0.91]In the multinomial regression model, HIV-positive cases had significantly higher relative risk ratio (RRR) for death [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 4.30 CI 2.31-7.99; Unknown MDR-TB status: 5.55 CI 3.10-9.92; MDR-TB: 3.59 CI 1.56-8.28] and being "still on treatment' [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 7.27 CI 3.00-17.6; Unknown MDR-TB status: 5.36 CI 2.44-11.8; MDR-TB: 3.76 CI 2.48-5.71].

abstract = {Background. Tuberculosis (TB) often occurs among household contacts of people with active TB. It is unclear whether clustering of cases represents household transmission or shared household risk factors for TB. Methods. We used cross-sectional data from 764 households in Lima, Peru, to estimate the relative contributions of household and community transmission, the average time between cases, and the immunity afforded by a previous TB infection. Results. The distribution of cases per household suggests that almost 7 of 10 nonindex household cases were infected in the community rather than in the household. The average interval between household cases was 3.5 years. We observed a saturation effect in the number of cases per household and estimated that protective immunity conferred up to 35{\%} reduction in the risk of disease. Conclusions. Cross-sectional household data can elucidate the natural history and transmission dynamics of TB. In this high-incidence setting, we found that the majority of cases were attributable to community transmission and that household contacts of case patients derive some immunity from household exposures. Screening of household contacts may be an effective method of detecting new TB cases if carried out over several years.},

abstract = {Background. Simulation models are useful in policy planning for tuberculosis (TB) control. To accurately assess interventions, important modifiers of the epidemic should be accounted for in evaluative models. Improvements in population health were associated with the declining TB epidemic in the pre–antibiotic era and may be relevant today. The objective of this study was to develop and validate a TB transmission model that accounted for changes in population health. Methods. We developed a deterministic TB transmission model, using reported data from the pre–antibiotic era in England. Change in adjusted life expectancy, used as a proxy for general health, was used to determine the rate of change of key epidemiological parameters. Predicted outcomes included risk of TB infection and TB mortality. The model was validated in the setting of the Netherlands and then applied to modern Peru. Results. The model, developed in the setting of England, predicted TB trends in the Netherlands very accurately. The R2 value for correlation between observed and predicted data was 0.97 and 0.95 for TB infection and mortality, respectively. In Peru, the predicted decline in incidence prior to the expansion of “Directly Observed Treatment Short Course” (The DOTS strategy) was 3.7{\%} per year (observed = 3.9{\%} per year). After DOTS expansion, the predicted decline was very similar to the observed decline of 5.8{\%} per year. Conclusions. We successfully developed and validated a TB model, which uses a proxy for population health to estimate changes in key epidemiology parameters. Population health contributed significantly to improvement in TB outcomes observed in Peru. Changing population health should be incorporated into evaluative models for global TB control.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The international controversy surrounding the use and effectiveness of the Bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine and the low incidence of tuberculosis (TB) among Japanese children prompted this study. METHODS: We compared 'universal BCG vaccination' with 'no vaccination at all' using a cost-effectiveness analysis. The study population was a hypothetical cohort comprising a total of 1.2 million infants born in 1996 at locations all over Japan. A model was developed to calculate the number of TB cases prevented by the vaccination programme. Assuming 40-80{\%} overall vaccine efficacy (64-86{\%} for TB-meningitis) and 10 years of protection, we calculated the cost and number of immunizations required to prevent one child from developing TB, the total number of TB cases averted by vaccination and total costs required for the programme. RESULTS: Based on an assumption of flexible vaccine efficacy (40-80{\%}), we estimated that 111-542 TB cases including 10-27 of TB-meningitis would be prevented during the 10 years after BCG vaccination among the cohort of infants born in 1996. About US{\$}35 950-175 862 or 2125-10 399 immunizations would be required to prevent one child from developing TB. Sensitivity analyses covering a wide duration of protection, incidence of TB, vaccine coverage and discount rate, revealed that other than vaccine efficacy, the cost of preventing a single case of TB is highly sensitive to the duration of BCG protection and TB incidence. CONCLUSION: The cost per case of TB prevented is heavily dependent on vaccine efficacy and the duration of protection, and is high compared with the cost of treating one child who has developed TB.},

abstract = {Macaques play a central role in the development of human tuberculosis (TB) vaccines. Immune and challenge responses differ across macaque and human subpopulations. We used novel immunostimulation/immunodynamic modeling methods in a proof-of-concept study to determine which macaque subpopulations best predicted immune responses in different human subpopulations. Data on gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-secreting CD4+ T cells over time after recent Mycobacterium bovis BCG vaccination were available for 55 humans and 81 macaques. Human population covariates were baseline BCG vaccination status, time since BCG vaccination, gender, and the monocyte/lymphocyte cell count ratio. The macaque population covariate was the colony of origin. A two-compartment mathematical model describing the dynamics of the IFN-gamma T cell response after BCG vaccination was calibrated to these data using nonlinear mixed-effects methods. The model was calibrated to macaque and human data separately. The association between subpopulations and the BCG immune response in each species was assessed. The macaque subpopulations that best predicted immune responses in different human subpopulations were identified using Bayesian information criteria. We found that the macaque colony and the human baseline BCG status were significantly (P {\textless} 0.05) associated with the BCG-induced immune response. For humans who were BCG naive at baseline, Indonesian cynomolgus macaques and Indian rhesus macaques best predicted the immune response. For humans who had already been BCG vaccinated at baseline, Mauritian cynomolgus macaques best predicted the immune response. This work suggests that the immune responses of different human populations may be best modeled by different macaque colonies, and it demonstrates the potential utility of immunostimulation/immunodynamic modeling to accelerate TB vaccine development.},

We did not find any significant association between HIV and TB treatment failure [Non-MDR-TB: RRR 0.50 CI 0.15-1.67; Unknown MDR-TB status: 1.51 CI 0.86-2.64; MDR-TB: 0.51 CI 0.13-1.87] CONCLUSION:: This large study confirms that HIV is a strong risk factor for an adverse TB treatment outcome, which is mainly manifested by an increased risk of death and still being on TB treatment.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT  The existing TB vaccine, the attenuated Mycobacterium bovis strain BCG, is effective in protecting infants from severe forms of the disease, while its efficacy in protecting adults from pulmonary TB is poor. In the last two decades, a renewed interest in TB resulted in the development of several candidate vaccines that are now entering clinical trials. However, most of these vaccines are based on a common rationale and aim to induce a strong T-cell response against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Recent advancements in the understanding of M. tuberculosis virulence determinants and associated pathogenic strategies are opening a new and broader view of the complex interaction between this remarkable pathogen and the human host, providing insights at molecular level that could lead to a new rationale for the design of novel antitubercular vaccines. A vaccination strategy that simultaneously targets different steps in TB pathogenesis may result in improved protection and reduced TB transmission.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the R package deSolve to solve initial value problems (IVP) written as ordinary differential equations (ODE), differential algebraic equations (DAE) of index 0 or 1 and partial differential equations (PDE), the latter solved using the method of lines approach. The differential equations can be represented in R code or as compiled code. In the latter case, R is used as a tool to trigger the integration and post-process the results, which facilitates model development and application, whilst the compiled code significantly increases simulation speed. The methods implemented are efficient, robust, and well documented public-domain Fortran routines. They include four integrators from the ODEPACK package (LSODE, LSODES, LSODA, LSODAR), DVODE and DASPK2.0. In addition, a suite of Runge-Kutta integrators and special-purpose solvers to efficiently integrate 1-, 2- and 3-dimensional partial differential equations are available. The routines solve both stiff and non-stiff systems, and include many options, e. g., to deal in an efficient way with the sparsity of the Jacobian matrix, or finding the root of equations. In this article, our objectives are threefold: (1) to demonstrate the potential of using R for dynamic modeling, (2) to highlight typical uses of the different methods implemented and (3) to compare the performance of models specified in R code and in compiled code for a number of test cases. These comparisons demonstrate that, if the use of loops is avoided, R code can efficiently integrate problems comprising several thousands of state variables. Nevertheless, the same problem may be solved from 2 to more than 50 times faster by using compiled code compared to an implementation using only R code. Still, amongst the bene fits of R are a more flexible and interactive implementation, better readability of the code, and access to R's high-level procedures. deSolve is the successor of packageo desolve which will be deprecated in the future; it is free software and distributed under the GNU General Public License, as part of the R software project.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The annual risk of infection (ARI) for tuberculosis is the probability that an individual without previous contact with the tubercle bacillus has of being infected during the course of a year. The ARI is the most appropriate indicator for estimating the degree of tuberculosis infection in a population. The objective of this paper was to estimate the ARI and its trends in the city of Cali, Colombia, using data provided by the Municipal Secretariat of Health. METHODS: We used a deterministic model of the dynamics of pulmonary tuberculosis. The flows among the population subgroups were based on the natural history of the disease, taking vaccination into account. Using the data from the Municipal Secretariat of Health, we estimated the initial conditions and the values of the parameters. RESULTS: The mean ARI values were 1.24{\%} in the 1970s, 0.93{\%} in the 1980s, and 0.85{\%} in the 1990s. In order to assess trends, we attempted to predict the annual risk, utilizing a nonlinear least-squares adjustment of the data on the overall percentage for each year. With that approach, we projected that the ARI in 2003 would be 1.3{\%}, indicating a return to the patterns found in the 1970s. CONCLUSIONS: The estimated risk of tuberculosis infection in Cali during the decades of the 1970s, the 1980s, and the 1990s was very high in comparison with the risk in countries such as the Netherlands, which in 1985 had an ARI of 0.012{\%}. However, the ARI in Cali is not so high in comparison to indices for other countries of South America, which range from 0.5{\%} to 1.5{\%}. This model and the simulation it produced showed a rising trend in the ARI for Cali, as well as demonstrated that the ARI will tend to continue to rise if control measures are not improved.},

abstract = {Efforts to stimulate technological innovation in the diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB) have resulted in the recent introduction of several novel diagnostic tools. As these products come to market, policy makers must make difficult decisions about which of the available tools to implement. This choice should depend not only on the test characteristics (e.g., sensitivity and specificity) of the tools, but also on how they will be used within the existing health care infrastructure. Accordingly, policy makers choosing between diagnostic strategies must decide: 1) What is the best combination of tools to select? 2)Who should be tested with the new tools? and 3)Will these tools complement or replace existing diagnostics? The best choice of diagnostic strategy will likely vary between settings with different epidemiology (e.g., levels of TB incidence, human immunodeficiency virus co-infection and drug-resistant TB) and structural and resource constraints (e.g., existing diagnostic pathways, human resources and laboratory capacity). We propose a joint modelling framework that includes a tuberculosis (TB) transmission component (a dynamic epidemiological model) and a health system component (an operational systems model) to support diagnostic strategy decisions. This modelling approach captures the complex feedback loops in this system: new diagnostic strategies alter the demands on and performance of health systems that impact TB transmission dynamics which, in turn, result in further changes to demands on the health system. We demonstrate the use of a simplified model to support the rational choice of a diagnostic strategy based on health systems requirements, patient outcomes and population-level TB impact.},

abstract = {This report presents detailed data on TB case notifications made to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system (ETS) in England to the end of 2014. This is a change in presentation compared with previous TB annual reports produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Public Health England (PHE), which reported detailed surveillance data for the whole of the UK. This change is consistent with the newly launched Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020 [1], and the fact that TB control activities, along with other health services, are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The one exception is the United Kingdom tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme (chapter 10), which is conducted for the whole of the UK. High-level data on TB notifications in the UK to the end of 2014, and breakdowns by country, can be found in the Official Statistic for TB, ‘Reports of cases of tuberculosis to enhanced tuberculosis surveillance systems: United Kingdom, 2000 to 2014'. This is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-othermycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data. As part of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020, a suite of TB Strategy Monitoring Indicators have been developed (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment{\_}data/file/403231/ Collaborative{\_}TB{\_}Strategy{\_}for{\_}England{\_}2015{\_}2020{\_}.pdf). Where data for these indicators are presented in this report, the indicator name is shown, and a summary table of national-level indicators is presented in Appendix V. Data for indicators which are presented at Upper Tier Local Authority can be found at http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tb-monitoring and will be updated with data for 2014 on 6th October 2015. Hyperlinks (in green) for specific indicators are also shown throughout the report where data are presented. TB data from 2000 are updated annually to take into account denotifications, late notifications and other updates. The data from the current year's report supersedes data in previous reports. Key points and recommendations This report presents detailed data on the occurrence and management of tuberculosis (TB) in England to the end of 2014, which should be used to inform the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020.  in the past three years there has been a year on year decline in the number of TB cases in England, down to 6,520 in 2014, a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 o despite this decline, the number of TB cases in England is still unacceptably high  the recent reduction in TB cases is mainly due to a reduction in cases in the nonUK born population, which make up nearly three-quarters of all TB cases in England o this reduction is likely in part to reflect recent declines in the number of migrants from high TB burden countries and the impact of pre-entry TB screening o the majority of non-UK born cases (86{\%}) are now notified more than two years after entering the UK, and are likely to be due to reactivation of latent TB infection o the roll out of latent TB testing and treatment, and further strengthening of TB services is required to ensure that the decline in non-UK born cases is sustained  there has been no downward trend in the incidence of TB in the UK born population in the past decade, with a rate of 3.9 per 100,000 in 2014 o 15{\%} of cases in the UK born population had at least one social risk factor, and 38{\%} were from minority ethnic groups  there is some evidence of a recent reduction in transmission of TB in England, with a decline in TB incidence in UK born children in the past six years o more substantial reductions in transmission will require improvements in early diagnosis, contact tracing and further improvements in treatment completion  treatment completion for drug sensitive cases has been improving over the past decade, with corresponding reductions in deaths and losses to follow-up  there has been a recent reduction in the number of new cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with 52 new cases diagnosed in 2014  nearly half of drug resistant cases with MDR/rifampicin resistant-TB (MDR/RRTB) notified in 2012 had not completed treatment by 24 months; these patients require specialised clinical management and considerable social support to achieve favourable outcomes Tuberculosis in England: 2015 report (presenting data to end of 2014) 8  the average delay from symptom onset to treatment start is unacceptably long and increasing; nearly one-third of pulmonary TB cases had a delay of more than four months in 2014 o to reduce this delay, improved awareness in affected communities and among health professionals, and improved access to high quality services are required  nearly one in ten TB cases in 2014 had at least one social risk factor, and there has been no reduction in the number of cases with social risk factors over the past five years o a higher proportion of those with social risk factors have drug resistant TB and worse TB outcomes, which highlights the added importance of tackling TB in this group, including through targeted outreach services  to achieve further reductions in TB in England over the next five years, including in new and settled migrant populations, in the UK born population, and among the most vulnerable groups, we need to build upon existing achievements and address gaps in current service provision; this will require the sustained and coordinated action of all key stakeholders, supported and overseen by the newly established TB control boards and national TB programme office},

This article provides a detailed review of the work on the dynamics and control of TB. The earliest mathematical models describing the TB dynamics appeared in the 1960s and focused on the prediction and control strategies using simulation approaches. Most recently developed models not only pay attention to simulations but also take care of dynamical analysis using modern knowledge of dynamical systems. Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) (both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent approval of interferon-gamma release assays that are more specific for Mycobacterium tuberculosis has given new options for the diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of Quanti-FERON-TB Gold (QFT-G) vs. the tuberculin skin test (TST) in diagnosing LTBI in contacts of active TB cases using a decision analytic Markov model. METHODS: Three screening strategies--TST alone, QFT-G alone and sequential screening of TST then QFT-G--were evaluated. The model was further stratified according to ethnicity and bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status. Data sources included published studies and empirical data. Results were reported in terms of the incremental net monetary benefit (INMB) of each strategy compared with the baseline strategy of TST-based screening in all contacts. RESULTS: The most economically attractive strategy was to administer QFT-G in BCG-vaccinated contacts, and to reserve TST for all others (INMB CA{\$}3.70/contact). The least cost-effective strategy was QFT-G for all contacts, which resulted in an INMB of CA{\$}-11.50 per contact. Assuming a higher prevalence of recent infection, faster conversion of QFT-G, a higher rate of TB reactivation, reduction in utility or greater adherence to preventive treatment resulted in QFT-G becoming cost-effective in more subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Selected use of QFT-G appears to be cost-effective if used in a targeted fashion.},

The number of TB patients admitted daily was treated as a Poisson random variable. A patient imparted a daily infection risk that was identical for all workers within a risk group but that varied between risk groups. In some scenarios, infected employees were assigned a daily risk of developing TB disease. If disease developed, the individual remained on the job for 3 calendar weeks and imparted a substantial infection risk to 25 close contacts. Simulations were run over 5-year intervals. Cumulative infection incidence increased over time and with more TB patients admitted. Given a scenario in which there were 600, 300, and 100 susceptibles in the low-, medium-, and high risk groups, respectively, 50 TB patients admitted annually and accounting for disease among infected employees, at 5 years there were approximately 100 primary infections (due to infection by patients), 40 secondary infections (due to infection by diseased coworkers), five primary disease cases, and two secondary disease cases. The input parameter values and simulation outcomes were reasonably consistent with the sparse information reported in the literature.},

abstract = {This report presents detailed data on TB case notifications made to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system (ETS) in England to the end of 2014. This is a change in presentation compared with previous TB annual reports produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Public Health England (PHE), which reported detailed surveillance data for the whole of the UK. This change is consistent with the newly launched Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020 [1], and the fact that TB control activities, along with other health services, are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The one exception is the United Kingdom tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme (chapter 10), which is conducted for the whole of the UK. High-level data on TB notifications in the UK to the end of 2014, and breakdowns by country, can be found in the Official Statistic for TB, ‘Reports of cases of tuberculosis to enhanced tuberculosis surveillance systems: United Kingdom, 2000 to 2014'. This is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-othermycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data. As part of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020, a suite of TB Strategy Monitoring Indicators have been developed (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment{\_}data/file/403231/ Collaborative{\_}TB{\_}Strategy{\_}for{\_}England{\_}2015{\_}2020{\_}.pdf). Where data for these indicators are presented in this report, the indicator name is shown, and a summary table of national-level indicators is presented in Appendix V. Data for indicators which are presented at Upper Tier Local Authority can be found at http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tb-monitoring and will be updated with data for 2014 on 6th October 2015. Hyperlinks (in green) for specific indicators are also shown throughout the report where data are presented. TB data from 2000 are updated annually to take into account denotifications, late notifications and other updates. The data from the current year's report supersedes data in previous reports. Key points and recommendations This report presents detailed data on the occurrence and management of tuberculosis (TB) in England to the end of 2014, which should be used to inform the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020.  in the past three years there has been a year on year decline in the number of TB cases in England, down to 6,520 in 2014, a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 o despite this decline, the number of TB cases in England is still unacceptably high  the recent reduction in TB cases is mainly due to a reduction in cases in the nonUK born population, which make up nearly three-quarters of all TB cases in England o this reduction is likely in part to reflect recent declines in the number of migrants from high TB burden countries and the impact of pre-entry TB screening o the majority of non-UK born cases (86{\%}) are now notified more than two years after entering the UK, and are likely to be due to reactivation of latent TB infection o the roll out of latent TB testing and treatment, and further strengthening of TB services is required to ensure that the decline in non-UK born cases is sustained  there has been no downward trend in the incidence of TB in the UK born population in the past decade, with a rate of 3.9 per 100,000 in 2014 o 15{\%} of cases in the UK born population had at least one social risk factor, and 38{\%} were from minority ethnic groups  there is some evidence of a recent reduction in transmission of TB in England, with a decline in TB incidence in UK born children in the past six years o more substantial reductions in transmission will require improvements in early diagnosis, contact tracing and further improvements in treatment completion  treatment completion for drug sensitive cases has been improving over the past decade, with corresponding reductions in deaths and losses to follow-up  there has been a recent reduction in the number of new cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with 52 new cases diagnosed in 2014  nearly half of drug resistant cases with MDR/rifampicin resistant-TB (MDR/RRTB) notified in 2012 had not completed treatment by 24 months; these patients require specialised clinical management and considerable social support to achieve favourable outcomes Tuberculosis in England: 2015 report (presenting data to end of 2014) 8  the average delay from symptom onset to treatment start is unacceptably long and increasing; nearly one-third of pulmonary TB cases had a delay of more than four months in 2014 o to reduce this delay, improved awareness in affected communities and among health professionals, and improved access to high quality services are required  nearly one in ten TB cases in 2014 had at least one social risk factor, and there has been no reduction in the number of cases with social risk factors over the past five years o a higher proportion of those with social risk factors have drug resistant TB and worse TB outcomes, which highlights the added importance of tackling TB in this group, including through targeted outreach services  to achieve further reductions in TB in England over the next five years, including in new and settled migrant populations, in the UK born population, and among the most vulnerable groups, we need to build upon existing achievements and address gaps in current service provision; this will require the sustained and coordinated action of all key stakeholders, supported and overseen by the newly established TB control boards and national TB programme office},

abstract = {A combination of continuous and categorical tests, none of which is a gold standard, is often available for classification of subject status in epidemiologic studies. For example, tuberculosis (TB) molecular epidemiology uses select mycobacterial DNA sequences to provide clues about which cases of active TB are likely clustered, implying recent transmission between these cases, versus reactivation of previously acquired infection. The proportion of recently transmitted cases is important to public health, as different control methods are implemented as transmission rates increase. Standard typing methods include IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110 RFLP), but recently developed polymerase chain reaction based genotyping modalities, including mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat and spoligotyping provide quicker results. In addition, it has recently been suggested that results from IS6110 RFLP can be used to create a continuous measure of genetic relatedness, called the nearest genetic distance. Whichever method is used, estimation of cluster rates is rendered difficult by the lack of a gold standard method for classifying cases as clustered or not. Since many of these methods are relatively new, their properties have not been extensively investigated. Misclassification errors subsequently lead to sub-optimal estimation of risk factors for clustering. Here we show how Bayesian latent class models can be used in such situations, for example to simultaneously analyse Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA data from all three of the above methods. Using the data collected at the Public Health Unit in Montreal, we estimate the proportion of clustered cases and the operating characteristics of each method using information from all three methods combined, including both continuous and dichotomous measures from IS6110 RFLP. A misclassification-adjusted regression model provides estimates of the effects of risk factors on the clustering probabilities. We also discuss how one must carefully interpret any inferences that arise from a combination of continuous and dichotomous tests.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Foreign-born persons in Canada contribute 67{\%} of all tuberculosis (TB) cases annually, but represent only 21{\%} of the total population. Molecular epidemiological studies suggest that most foreign-born TB cases result from the reactivation of latent tuberculous infection (LTBI) acquired before immigration. OBJECTIVE : To estimate the effect on incidence of a prevention strategy that would screen selected immigrants at arrival for LTBI and offer preventive treatment to those who test positive. DESIGN: A deterministic model was developed to quantify the incidence of active TB in immigrants to Canada and validated with national immigration and TB case data. RESULTS : Model simulations suggested that it would be optimal to screen and treat LTBI in new immigrants from countries of birth with an estimated TB incidence rate in excess of 50 per 100 000 person-years. If this strategy had been implemented in 1986, the national TB incidence rate would have fallen by 18.5{\%}, from 5.4 to 4.4 cases per 100 000 population by 2002. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that screening and treating LTBI in foreign-born persons from high TB incidence countries is the most effective strategy in terms of total persons screened and treated and percentage reduction in national incidence. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Union.},

abstract = {Some of the most promising vaccines in the pipeline for tuberculosis (TB) target adolescents and adults. Unlike for childhood vaccines, high-coverage population-wide vaccination is significantly more challenging for adult vaccines. Here, we aimed to estimate the impact of vaccine delivery strategies that were targeted to high-incidence geographical 'hotspots' compared with randomly allocated vaccination. We developed a spatially explicit mathematical model of TB transmission that distinguished these hotspots from the general population. We evaluated the impact of targeted and untargeted vaccine delivery strategies in India--a country that bears more than 25{\%} of global TB burden, and may be a potential early adopter of the vaccine. We collected TB notification data and conducted a demonstration study in the state of Gujarat to validate our estimates of heterogeneity in TB incidence. We then projected the impact of randomly vaccinating 8{\%} of adults in a single mass campaign to a spatially targeted vaccination preferentially delivered to 80{\%} of adults in the hotspots, with both strategies augmented by continuous adolescent vaccination. In consultation with vaccine developers, we considered a vaccine efficacy of 60{\%}, and evaluated the population-level impact after 10 years of vaccination. Spatial heterogeneity in TB notification (per 100,000/year) was modest in Gujarat: 190 in the hotspots versus 125 in the remaining population. At this level of heterogeneity, the spatially targeted vaccination was projected to reduce TB incidence by 28{\%} after 10 years, compared with a 24{\%} reduction projected to achieve via untargeted vaccination--a 1.17-fold augmentation in the impact of vaccination by spatially targeting. The degree of the augmentation was robust to reasonable variation in natural history assumptions, but depended strongly on the extent of spatial heterogeneity and mixing between the hotspot and general population. Identifying high-incidence hotspots and quantifying spatial mixing patterns are critical to accurate estimation of the value of targeted intervention strategies.},

abstract = {A nonlinear mathematical model is proposed to study the effect of tuberculosis on the spread of HIV infection in a logistically growing human population. The host population is divided into four sub classes of susceptibles, TB infectives, HIV infectives (with or without TB) and that of AIDS patients. The model exhibits four equilibria namely, a disease free, HIV free, TB free and an endemic equilibrium. The model has been studied qualitatively using stability theory of nonlinear differential equations and computer simulation. We have found a threshold parameter R 0 which is if less than one, the disease free equilibrium is locally asymptotically stable otherwise for R 0 {\textgreater} 1 , at least one of the infections will be present in the population. It is shown that the positive endemic equilibrium is always locally stable but it may become globally stable under certain conditions showing that the disease becomes endemic. It is found that as the number of TB infectives decreases due to recovery, the number of HIV infectives also decreases and endemic equilibrium tends to TB free equilibrium. It is also observed that number of AIDS individuals decreases if TB is not associated with HIV infection. A numerical study of the model is also performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters on the spread of the disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In July 2008 a case of smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) in a white UK-born nursery teacher was notified in London. The case had been symptomatic for 9 months while working in the nursery. The outbreak is described and the protective effect of BCG vaccination against latent Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection as measured by an interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) is assessed. METHODS: Screening by chest X-ray and IGRA of nursery children, staff and their contacts was conducted using a 'stone-in-the pond' approach. Information was collected on various factors including BCG vaccination status, and data were analysed using multivariable logistic regression. RESULTS: Overall, 168 children, 31 staff members and 57 other adults associated with the nursery were screened for TB. There were 12 cases of active TB and 43 cases of latent TB (72{\%} children). 37.5{\%} (95{\%} CI 18{\%} to 56{\%}) and 40{\%} (95{\%} CI 30{\%} to 50{\%}) had a positive IGRA among teachers and children, respectively. 42{\%} of children and 60{\%} of adults were BCG vaccinated. In the adjusted analysis, BCG vaccination showed a significant protective effect against M tuberculosis infection in children (OR 0.25, 95{\%} CI 0.09 to 0.69) and being taught by the index case was associated with acquiring TB infection (OR 18.91, 95{\%} CI 4.43 to 80.79). A vaccine effectiveness of 66{\%} was calculated, implying that 21 of the 32 infections could have been avoided if all children had been vaccinated with BCG. CONCLUSIONS: This outbreak shows extensive transmission of TB among very young children. BCG seems to have a protective effect against TB infection as assessed by positive IGRA in this cohort.},

abstract = {Highly non-linear, chaotic or near chaotic, dynamic models are important in fields such as ecology and epidemiology: for example, pest species and diseases often display highly non-linear dynamics. However, such models are problematic from the point of view of statistical inference. The defining feature of chaotic and near chaotic systems is extreme sensitivity to small changes in system states and parameters, and this can interfere with inference. There are two main classes of methods for circumventing these difficulties: information reduction approaches, such as Approximate Bayesian Computation or Synthetic Likelihood and state space methods, such as Particle Markov chain Monte Carlo, Iterated Filtering or Parameter Cascading. The purpose of this article is to compare the methods, in order to reach conclusions about how to approach inference with such models in practice. We show that neither class of methods is universally superior to the other. We show that state space methods can suffer multimodality problems in settings with low process noise or model mis-specification, leading to bias toward stable dynamics and high process noise. Information reduction methods avoid this problem but, under the correct model and with sufficient process noise, state space methods lead to substantially sharper inference than information reduction methods. More practically, there are also differences in the tuning requirements of different methods. Our overall conclusion is that model development and checking should probably be performed using an information reduction method with low tuning requirements, while for final inference it is likely to be better to switch to a state space method, checking results against the information reduction approach.},

abstract = {Vaccination is one of the major medical advances of the 20th century. Although vaccination was scientifically in- vestigated by Edward Jenner in the late 18th century, it was not until the biochemical advances of the 20th century that cheap, safe vaccines could be produced in large quantities. Vacci- nation is a powerful tool in the public-health control arsenal, and allows for the mass prevention of infection rather than treating the symptoms of infection. Vaccination saves thousands of lives each year in the UK alone. In simple terms, vaccineswork by forcing the body to mount an immune reaction, which in turn generates immunity to future in- fections of this particular pathogen (and strain); this immunity is generally assumed to last a lifetime. In the past many vaccines contained small quantities of the infecting organism, but most modern vaccines simply contain sufficient parts of the pathogen to enable an immune response combined with chemicals (adju- vants) that promote this immune reaction. Vaccination is a multi- billion pound industry, with the UK spending over {\pounds}200 million a year and offering over 10 different regular vaccines. So where does mathematics fit into this? Various elements of mathematics are used throughout the vaccine development pro- cess; but herewe focus on the use of mathematics in public health, understanding the impact of vaccination at the population level.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: BCG vaccine protects against the severe forms of tuberculosis (TB) in children. Several low-prevalence countries are reviewing their policy, usually shifting from universal vaccination to vaccination of infants in high-risk groups only. We combined an epidemiologic analysis with a cost-effectiveness analysis to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of targeted strategies. METHODS: We fitted a static model to the data to estimate vaccine efficacy and risk of disease. We applied our method to the Dutch situation, analyzing severe TB cases in high-risk group children age 0-5, between 1996 and 2003. We considered the current strategy targeting immigrant children from high-incidence countries, and a proposed strategy additionally targeting children from 3 lower-incidence, but higher-immigration, countries. RESULTS: In the absence of vaccination, the annual risk of developing severe TB for a child in the current target group is 3/100,000, while BCG vaccination reduces this risk by 73{\%}. Therefore about 9000 children would need to be vaccinated to prevent 1 case. Vaccinating children from high-incidence countries would then cost about Euro 4,500 per discounted disability-adjusted life year averted. In the extended target group, the risk of disease is somewhat lower with a similar vaccine effectiveness, so costs are raised. CONCLUSIONS: The current Dutch BCG strategy, as well as the proposed inclusion of immigrant children from Turkey, Surinam and former Yugoslavia, is on average cost-effective. However, the low number of both vaccinated and unvaccinated severe TB cases leads to broad confidence intervals on vaccine efficacy, highlighting the difficulty associated with decision-making in low-prevalence settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mathematical models of tuberculosis (TB) transmission have been used to characterize disease dynamics, investigate the potential effects of public health interventions, and prioritize control measures. While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. METHODS: A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. RESULTS: The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: Demographic modelling assumptions should be considered in the interpretation of models of chronic infectious diseases such as TB. For simple models, we find that assuming constant lifetimes, rather than exponential lifetimes, produces dynamics more representative of models with realistic age structure.},

abstract = {In Eastern Europe and Central Asia (ECA) the control of tuberculosis, multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) poses important public health challenges. We used system dynamics simulation to determine impact on cumulative HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and HIV-associated-tuberculosis deaths, over 20 years, of harm-reduction programmes to reduce needle-sharing and injection-frequency amongst injecting drug users (IDUs) and multidrug resistant tuberculosis (MDRTB) control in a population with an explosive HIV epidemic in IDUs and high MDRTB prevalence. We estimate that the number of HIV-associated-deaths will decline by 30{\%} with effective harm-reduction programmes but double if these are ineffective. In our model, effective MDRTB and HIV control reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 54{\%}, cumulative MDRTB deaths 15-fold and cumulative HIV-associated-tuberculosis-deaths 2-fold. Effective MDRTB control, without effective harm-reduction programmes, only reduce tuberculosis deaths by 22{\%}. However, effective harm-reduction programme with a poor MDRTB control reduce cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 34{\%}, MDRTB by 14{\%} and HIV-associated-tuberculosis by 56{\%}. Even with good control programmes for drug sensitive TB, neglecting harm reduction and MDRTB control will result in 50{\%} more tuberculosis-related deaths than if both are effectively addressed. Effective harm-reduction programmes reduces cumulative deaths from tuberculosis more substantively than effective MDRTB control. Our finding have important policy implications for communicable disease policies in post-Soviet countries, which need to substantially change if they are to effectively address the emerging HIV and MDRTB epidemics.},

abstract = {Background: Prior infection with one strain TB has been linked with diminished likelihood of re-infection by a new strain. This paper attempts to determine the role of declining prevalence of drug-susceptible TB in enabling future epidemics of MDR-TB. Methods: A computer simulation of MDR-TB epidemics was developed using an agent-based model platform programmed in NetLogo (See http://mdr.tbtools.org/). Eighty-one scenarios were created, varying levels of treatment quality, diagnostic accuracy, microbial fitness cost, and the degree of immunogenicity elicited by drug-susceptible TB. Outcome measures were the number of independent MDR-TB cases per trial and the proportion of trials resulting in MDR-TB epidemics for a 500 year period after drug therapy for TB is introduced. Results: MDR-TB epidemics propagated more extensively after TB prevalence had fallen. At a case detection rate of 75{\%}, improving therapeutic compliance from 50{\%} to 75{\%} can reduce the probability of an epidemic from 45{\%} to 15{\%}. Paradoxically, improving the case-detection rate from 50{\%} to 75{\%} when compliance with DOT is constant at 75{\%} increases the probability of MDR-TB epidemics from 3{\%} to 45{\%}. Conclusions: The ability of MDR-TB to spread depends on the prevalence of drug-susceptible TB. Immunologic protection conferred by exposure to drug-susceptible TB can be a crucial factor that prevents MDR-TB epidemics when TB treatment is poor. Any single population that successfully reduces its burden of drug-susceptible TB will have reduced herd immunity to externally or internally introduced strains of MDR-TB and can experience heightened vulnerability to an epidemic. Since countries with good TB control may be more vulnerable, their self interest dictates greater promotion of case detection and DOTS implementation in countries with poor control to control their risk of MDR-TB.},

@article{Magombedze2006,
abstract = {This work elaborates on the effects of cytotoxic lymphocytes (CTLs) and other immune mechanisms in determining whether a TB-infected individual will develop active or latent TB. It answers one intriguing question: why do individuals infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) experience different clinical outcomes? In addressing this question, we have developed a model that captures the effects of CTLs and the combined effects of CD4+ helper T cells (Th1 and Th2) immune response mechanisms to TB infection. The occurrence of active or latent infection is shown to depend on a number of factors that include effector function and levels of CTLs. We use the model to predict disease progression scenarios, including primary, latency or clearance. Model analysis shows that occurrence of active disease is much attributed to the Mtb pathogen ability to persist outside the intracellular environment and that high levels of CTLs result in latent TB, while low levels of CTLs result in active TB. This is attributed to the CTLs' ability to directly kill infected macrophages and the bacteria inside the infected macrophages. The study suggests directions for further basic studies and potential new treatment strategies.},

abstract = {The link between diabetes mellitus and tuberculosis has been recognised for centuries. In recent decades, tuberculosis incidence has declined in high-income countries, but incidence remains high in countries that have high rates of infection with HIV, high prevalence of malnutrition and crowded living conditions, or poor tuberculosis control infrastructure. At the same time, diabetes mellitus prevalence is soaring globally, fuelled by obesity. There is growing evidence that diabetes mellitus is an important risk factor for tuberculosis and might affect disease presentation and treatment response. Furthermore, tuberculosis might induce glucose intolerance and worsen glycaemic control in people with diabetes. We review the epidemiology of the tuberculosis and diabetes epidemics, and provide a synopsis of the evidence for the role of diabetes mellitus in susceptibility to, clinical presentation of, and response to treatment for tuberculosis. In addition, we review potential mechanisms by which diabetes mellitus can cause tuberculosis, the effects of tuberculosis on diabetic control, and pharmacokinetic issues related to the co-management of diabetes and tuberculosis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

We estimate an average risk of TB transmission on the order of 1 chance in 1,000 for all passengers using the OBM. Applying the more realistic SBM, we show that the risk and incidence decrease sharply in a stepwise fashion in cabins downstream from the cabin containing the source case assuming some potential for airflow from more contaminated to less contaminated cabins. We further characterized spatial variability in the risk within the cabin by modeling a previously reported TB outbreak in an airplane to demonstrate that the TB cases occur most likely within close proximity of the source TB patient.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: We hypothesized that investments to improve the control of tuberculosis in selected high-incidence countries would prove to be cost saving for the United States by reducing the incidence of the disease among migrants. METHODS: Using decision analysis, we estimated tuberculosis-related morbidity, mortality, and costs among legal immigrants and refugees, undocumented migrants, and temporary visitors from Mexico after their entry into the United States. We assessed the current strategy of radiographic screening of legal immigrants plus current tuberculosis-control programs alone and with the addition of either U.S.-funded expansion of the strategy of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), in Mexico or tuberculin skin testing to screen legal immigrants from Mexico. We also examined tuberculosis-related outcomes among migrants from Haiti and the Dominican Republic using the same three strategies. RESULTS: As compared with the current strategy, expanding the DOTS program in Mexico at a cost to the United States of 34.9 million dollars would result in 2591 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States, with 349 fewer deaths from the disease and net discounted savings of 108 million dollars over a 20-year period. Adding tuberculin skin testing to radiographic screening of legal immigrants from Mexico would result in 401 fewer cases of tuberculosis in the United States but would cost an additional 329 million dollars. Expansion of the DOTS program would remain cost saving even if the initial investment were doubled, if the United States paid for all antituberculosis drugs in Mexico, or if the decline in the incidence of tuberculosis in Mexico was less than projected. A 9.4 million dollars investment to expand the DOTS program in Haiti and the Dominican Republic would result in net U.S. savings of 20 million dollars over a 20-year period. CONCLUSIONS: U.S.-funded efforts to expand the DOTS program in Mexico, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic could reduce tuberculosis-related morbidity and mortality among migrants to the United States, producing net cost savings for the United States.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) control programs have been less successful among children than among adults in the United States. Between 1992 and 1997, the rate of decline of TB cases among 0- to 14-year-old children was less than the rate of decline among any other age group of US-born persons. Because of the higher prevalence of active TB among adults and their higher infectivity, most programs for TB in the United States have targeted adults. The inherent assumption has been that by targeting adults, from whom children may become infected, TB morbidity and mortality among children also will be reduced effectively. METHODS: Using a semi-Markov model that divided the US population into age groups {\textless}15 years old and {\textgreater}/=15 years old and into 18 clinical states based on the risk for or presence of TB and human immunodeficiency virus infection, we developed a computer-based simulation model to examine the effect of a range of potential TB control strategies on projected TB cases and deaths in children. We compare the impact of interventions targeted at children with the impact of interventions targeted at adults on pediatric morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: After 10 years, a 5{\%} increase in the number of adults with TB who enter treatment would only lead to a.05{\%} decline in TB cases among children, compared with predicted cases without this intervention. Improving treatment efficacy among those adults who are already receiving treatment for their TB leads to a smaller decline in cases among children of only.003{\%}. In contrast, a 5{\%} increase in the number of children who enter treatment leads to a 25{\%} decline, after 10 years, in the number of TB cases among children and a 16{\%} decline in the number of TB deaths. In the presence of immigration of tuberculin-positive children, the benefit of targeting programs directly at children is magnified. CONCLUSIONS: Marginal changes in programs targeted directly at children are significantly more effective at further reducing pediatric TB morbidity and mortality than the same changes in programs targeted at adults with the indirect goal of reducing spread to children. Marginal increases in the number of children who enter treatment are far more effective at decreasing morbidity and mortality than equivalent marginal increases in treatment effectiveness. Unfortunately, declining insurance coverage and increasing restrictions on services to immigrants have made it harder for those who are at greatest risk of TB to get medical care. Marginal increases in preventive therapy rates substantially reduce future pediatric TB cases and deaths among children with TB infection and human immunodeficiency virus.},

abstract = {An epidemiological model is presented that considers five possible states of a population: susceptible (S), exposed (W), infectious (Y), in treatment (Z) and recovered (R). In certain instances transition rates (from one state to another) depend on the time spent in the state; therefore the states W, Y and Z depend on time and length of stay in that state - similar to age-structured models. The model is particularly amenable to describe delays of exposed persons to become infectious and re-infection of exposed persons. Other transitions that depend on state time include the case finding and diagnosis, increased death rate and treatment interruption. The mathematical model comprises of a set of partial differential and ordinary differential equations. Non-steady state solutions are first presented, followed by a bifurcation study of the stationary states.},

abstract = {The immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection is the formation of multicellular lesions, or granolomas, in the lung of the individual. However, the structure of the granulomas and the spatial distribution of the immune cells within is not well understood. In this paper we develop a mathematical model investigating the early and initial immune response to Mtb. The model consists of coupled reaction-diffusion-advection partial differential equations governing the dynamics of the relevant macrophage and bacteria populations and a bacteria-produced chemokine. Our novel application of mathematical concepts of internal states and internal velocity allows us to begin to study this unique immunological structure. Volume changes resulting from proliferation and death terms generate a velocity field by which all cells are transported within the forming granuloma. We present numerical results for two distinct infection outcomes: controlled and uncontrolled granuloma growth. Using a simplified model we are able to analytically determine conditions under which the bacteria population decreases, representing early clearance of infection, or grows, representing the initial stages of granuloma formation.},

abstract = {Recognizing that tuberculosis (TB) is still the leading cause of human death from a curable infection, the international health community has set ambitious targets for disease control. One target is to eliminate TB by 2050; that is, to cut the annual incidence of new cases to less than 1 per million population. National TB control programmes are working to eliminate TB mainly by intensifying efforts to find and cure patients with active disease. Here, we use mathematical modelling to show that, while most TB patients can be cured with present drug regimens, the 2050 target is far more likely to be achieved with a combination of diagnostics, drugs and vaccines that can detect and treat both latent infection and active disease. We find that the coupling of control methods is particularly effective because treatments for latent infection and active disease act in synergy. This synergistic effect offers new perspectives on the cost-effectiveness of treating latent TB infection and the impact of possible new TB vaccines. Our results should be a stimulus to those who develop, manufacture and implement new technology for TB control, and to their financial donors.},

abstract = {The second report of the Medical Research Council trial of tuberculosis vaccines in adolescents (Medical Research Council, 1959) contained an estimate of the benefit to be expected from BCG vaccination. If all those tuberculin-negative on entry to the trial in 1950–52, at the age of 14 years, had been vaccinated with BCG, the reduction in the incidence of tuberculosis in the ensuing five years would have been 59 per cent.The present study, by taking into account the recent decrease in risk of exposure to tuberculous infection in England and Wales, provides similar estimates of the scope for BCG vaccination, which are more up to date and also applicable to the whole country.Of the tuberculosis notifications among those aged 15–19 years in England and Wales in 1958, it is estimated that 52 per cent could have been prevented by BCG vaccination at the age of 14 years of all who were then tuberculin-negative. This estimate for 1958 is compared with that for 1953, which was 60 per cent. There has thus been a moderate decline in the scope for BCG vaccination during these five years. If the trend in exposure to tuberculous infection continues, BCG vaccination of all tuberculin-negative children who are aged 14 years now (1959) would apparently reduce the incidence when they become 15–19 years of age by rather less than half.In terms of the numbers of cases preventable by BCG vaccination of children aged 14 years, the scope has declined very considerably, from about 2,950 notifications among those aged 15–19 years in 1953, to 1,400 in the same age group in 1958. We may in a few years reach a situation in this country in which mass vaccination of older school children prevents only small numbers of cases of tuberculosis in adolescents. If, however, the protection from vaccination is maintained, cases will also be prevented in those aged 20 years and over.It is estimated that the official scheme for BCG vaccination at the age of 13 years, which started at the end of 1953, reduced the numbers of notifications at ages 15–19 years in England and Wales by 50 in 1956, 156 in 1957 and 241 in 1958. These small numbers are due to incomplete coverage of the 15–19 year age group in these years and the slow development of the scheme.It is suggested that a central bureau should be established to collect and interpret the information in connexion with the official vaccination scheme. This could make a valuable contribution to the eradication of tuberculosis from this country. },

Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and persistence of solutions are presented. The model is numerically analyzed to assess the effects of smoking on the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. Numerical simulations of the model show that smoking enhances tuberculosis transmission, progression to active disease and in a population of smokers, tuberculosis cannot be controlled even when treatment success is assumed to be as high as 88{\%}. Further, analysis of the reproduction numbers indicates that the number of active tuberculosis cases increases as the number of smokers increase.},

TB is now the second most common cause of death from infectious disease in the world after human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Tuberculosis is a leading cause of infectious mortality. Although anti-biotic treatment is available and there is vaccine, tuberculosis levels are rising in many areas of the world. Mathematical models have been used to study tuberculosis in the past and have influenced policy; the spread of HIV and the emergence of drug-resistant TB strains motivate the use of mathematical models today In the recent year, the Biomathmetics has become the main important trend of research dirction which has applied to the epidemic models of disease mechanism, spreading, regulation, and stategy of disease preventing in the field of medical and public health. The papers will apply Lyapunov stability function V (x) to construct a dynamic mathematics models for tuberculosis and to meet the above-mentioned TB disease mechanism,spreading regulation, and stategy of disease preventing in the medical field. The theory of Lyapunov stability function is a general rule and method to examine and determine the stability characteristics of a dynamic system. There are two functions of Lyapunov theory: (a) the Lyapunov indirect method which solves the dynamics differential equations of the constructing system then determines its stability properties, and (b) the Lyapunov direct method which determine the system stability directly via constructing a Lyapunov Energy Function V(x) of the dynamic mathematic model for tuberculosis. Here we will analyse the complex dynamic mathematic model of tuberculosis epidemic and determine its stability property by using the popular Matlab/Simulink software and relative software packages.},

abstract = {To help reach the target of tuberculosis (TB) disease elimination by 2050, vaccine development needs to occur now. We estimated the impact and cost-effectiveness of potential TB vaccines in low- and middle-income countries using an age-structured transmission model. New vaccines were assumed to be available in 2024, to prevent active TB in all individuals, to have a 5-y to lifetime duration of protection, to have 40-80{\%} efficacy, and to be targeted at "infants" or "adolescents/adults." Vaccine prices were tiered by income group (US {\$}1.50-{\$}10 per dose), and cost-effectiveness was assessed using incremental cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY) averted compared against gross national income per capita. Our results suggest that over 2024-2050, a vaccine targeted to adolescents/adults could have a greater impact than one targeted at infants. In low-income countries, a vaccine with a 10-y duration and 60{\%} efficacy targeted at adolescents/adults could prevent 17 (95{\%} range: 11-24) million TB cases by 2050 and could be considered cost-effective at {\$}149 (cost saving to {\$}387) per DALY averted. If targeted at infants, 0.89 (0.42-1.58) million TB cases could be prevented at {\$}1,692 ({\$}634-{\$}4,603) per DALY averted. This profile targeted at adolescents/adults could be cost-effective at {\$}4, {\$}9, and {\$}20 per dose in low-, lower-middle-, and upper-middle-income countries, respectively. Increased investments in adult-targeted TB vaccines may be warranted, even if only short duration and low efficacy vaccines are likely to be feasible, and trials among adults should be powered to detect low efficacies.},

abstract = {Estimating the causal effect of some exposure on some outcome is the goal of many epidemiological studies. This article reviews a formal definition of causal effect for such studies. For simplicity, the main description is restricted to dichotomous variables and assumes that no random error attributable to sampling variability exists. The appendix provides a discussion of sampling variability and a generalisation of this causal theory. The difference between association and causation is described-the redundant expression "causal effect" is used throughout the article to avoid confusion with a common use of "effect" meaning simply statistical association-and shows why, in theory, randomisation allows the estimation of causal effects without further assumptions. The article concludes with a discussion on the limitations of randomised studies. These limitations are the reason why methods for causal inference from observational data are needed.},

abstract = {The Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli's potency to cause persistent latent infection that is unresponsive to the current cocktail of TB drugs is strongly associated with its ability to adapt to changing intracellular environments, and tolerating, evading and subverting host defence mechanisms. We applied a combination of bioinformatics and mathematical modelling methods to enhance the understanding of TB latency dynamics. Analysis of time course microarray gene expression data was carried out and gene profiles for bacilli adaptation and survival in latency, simulated by hypoxia were determined. Reverse network engineering techniques were used to predict gene dependencies and regulatory interactions. Biochemical systems theory was applied to mathematically model the inferred gene regulatory networks. Significant regulatory genes involved in latency were determined by a combination of systems biology procedures and mathematical modelling of the inferred regulatory networks. Analysis of gene clusters of the inferred networks in the stationary and non-replicating phases of the bacilli predicted probable functions of some of the latency genes to be associated with latency genes of known functions. The systems biology approach and mathematical computational deletion experiments predicted key genes in the TB latency/dormancy program that may be possible TB drug targets. However, these gene candidates require experimental testing and validation.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: The rate of tuberculosis (TB) among US homeless persons may be 20 times that of the general adult population. Studies suggest that the majority of urban homeless TB cases are attributable to ongoing transmission of TB. Optimal TB-control strategies in both chronically and transiently homeless populations are not known. OBJECTIVE: To examine the effects of TB-control strategies on projected TB cases and deaths in US homeless populations using a computer-based simulation model. DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: The US general population and a theoretical population of 2 million homeless individuals in 1995 were divided into 18 clinical states based on the risk for or presence of TB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in a semi-Markov model. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of transiently and chronically homeless individuals with active TB and deaths from TB as a function of public health measures taken to control and eliminate TB, including improvement of treatment effectiveness, improvement in access to treatment, and vaccination with BCG. RESULTS: A 10{\%} increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with active TB produced larger declines in predicted TB cases and deaths after 10 years (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons decreased 12.5{\%} and 19.8{\%} and among transiently homeless persons dropped 35.9{\%} and 32.4{\%}, respectively) than improvements in the effectiveness of treatment programs (cases and deaths among chronically homeless persons declined 7.2{\%} and 3.1{\%} and among transiently homeless persons dropped 10.9{\%} and 4.1{\%}, respectively). A 10{\%} increase in access to treatment among homeless persons with latent TB infection led to a 6.7{\%} decline in TB among chronically homeless persons and a 5.7{\%} decline among transiently homeless persons, while a 10{\%} improvement in effectiveness of treatment for latent TB infection was associated with declines of 3.0{\%} and 3.3{\%}, respectively. When treatment for latent TB infection was modeled to be the same in vaccinated and nonvaccinated populations, BCG vaccination led to TB case declines of 15.4{\%} and 21.5{\%} in chronically and transiently homeless populations, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Overcoming barriers faced by homeless individuals in accessing TB treatment programs will be crucial to reducing the burden of TB in this high-risk group. Increased treatment access, improvement in the effectiveness of treatment programs, and BCG vaccination of HIV-negative homeless individuals have the best chance to markedly decrease TB morbidity and mortality.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested that the bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine may have a non-specific beneficial effect on childhood survival in areas with high mortality. We examined whether BCG-vaccinated children with a BCG scar or a positive tuberculin reaction had better survival than children without such reactions. As part of an ongoing two-dose measles vaccine trial for which children were recruited at 6 months of age, we examined 1813 children for BCG scar at 6 months of age and 813 BCG-vaccinated children were skin-tested for delayed hypersensitivity to tuberculin, tetanus and diphtheria. We found that BCG-vaccinated children with a BCG scar had significantly lower mortality compared with BCG scar-negative children, the mortality ratio in the first 12 months of follow-up being 0.41 (0.25-0.67). BCG-vaccinated children with a positive tuberculin test had a mortality ratio of 0.45 (0.24-0.85) compared with tuberculin negative children. These results were unchanged by control for potential confounders or using different cut-off points for a tuberculin-positive response. Exclusion of dead children who had HIV antibodies did not modify the estimate (mortality rate (MR)=0.46 (0.23-0.94)). After censoring for tuberculosis (TB) exposure at home, the mortality ratios for having a scar and being tuberculin-positive were 0.46 (0.27-0.79) or 0.42 (0.21-0.84), respectively. Children positive to tetanus or diphtheria in the skin test had the same mortality as children not responding to these vaccine-related antigens. Thus, BCG scar and a positive tuberculin reaction were associated with better survival in early childhood in an area with high mortality. Since nothing similar was found for responders to diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) vaccine, and the effect could not be explained by protection against tuberculosis, the effect of BCG vaccination could be due to non-specific immune-stimulation protecting against other infections. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {Most childhood interventions (vaccines, micronutrients) in low-income countries are justified by their assumed effect on child survival. However, usually the interventions have only been studied with respect to their disease/deficiency-specific effects and not for their overall effects on morbidity and mortality. In many situations, the population-based effects have been very different from the anticipated effects; for example, the measles-preventive high-titre measles vaccine was associated with 2-fold increased female mortality; BCG reduces neonatal mortality although children do not die of tuberculosis in the neonatal period; vitamin A may be associated with increased or reduced child mortality in different situations; effects of interventions may differ for boys and girls. The reasons for these and other contrasts between expectations and observations are likely to be that the immune system learns more than specific prevention from an intervention; such training may enhance or reduce susceptibility to unrelated infections. INDEPTH member centres have been in an ideal position to document such additional non-specific effects of interventions because they follow the total population long term. It is proposed that more INDEPTH member centres extend their routine data collection platform to better measure the use and effects of childhood interventions. In a longer perspective, INDEPTH may come to play a stronger role in defining health research issues of relevance to low-income countries.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether differences in national trends in tuberculosis incidence are attributable to the variable success of control programmes or to biological, social and economic factors. METHODS: We used trends in case notifications as a measure of trends in incidence in 134 countries, from 1997 to 2006, and used regression analysis to explore the associations between these trends and 32 measures covering various aspects of development (1), the economy (6), the population (3), behavioural and biological risk factors (9), health services (6) and tuberculosis (TB) control (7). FINDINGS: The TB incidence rate changed annually within a range of +/-10{\%} over the study period in the 134 countries examined, and its average value declined in 93 countries. The rate was declining more quickly in countries that had a higher human development index, lower child mortality and access to improved sanitation. General development measures were also dominant explanatory variables within regions, though correlation with TB incidence trends varied geographically. The TB incidence rate was falling more quickly in countries with greater health expenditure (situated in central and eastern Europe and the eastern Mediterranean), high-income countries with lower immigration, and countries with lower child mortality and HIV infection rates (located in Latin America and the Caribbean). The intensity of TB control varied widely, and a possible causal link with TB incidence was found only in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the rate of detection of smear-positive cases showed a negative correlation with national incidence trends. CONCLUSION: Although TB control programmes have averted millions of deaths, their effects on transmission and incidence rates are not yet widely detectable.},

abstract = {Over the past few years there have been an increasing number of research articles published in Thorax on respiratory tract infections (including tuberculosis) affecting children and adults. Although these articles cover a wide variety of areas, several broad themes can be discerned. These include greater interest in viral respiratory infections (partially stimulated by the recent influenza A pandemic), improved characterisation of who is at risk of community-acquired pneumonia and mycobacterial infection, research into better diagnostics and attempts to develop new or improved scoring scales for a range of respiratory infection syndromes. There have also been a limited number of articles on how to manage patients with respiratory infection, including describing the efficacy of prevention by vaccination. Overall, there has been a discernible emphasis on transferring advances in clinical science to actual clinical practice, with several papers using molecular methodologies or measuring levels of cytokines or other potential biomarkers to improve diagnostic accuracy in patients with lung infection. There have also been manuscripts linking specific pathogen genotypes to infection phenotype, an area that is likely to be increasingly important in explaining some of the variations in severity between patients with respiratory infection. However, many questions remain on the optimum strategies for the management and prevention of pneumonia, bronchiectasis and tuberculosis, and there remains a strong need for further clinical research in order to make substantial improvements in the management of patients with lung infection.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in The Netherlands has been declining for many years. For the purpose of planning future TB-control activities we estimated the number of TB patients in The Netherlands up to 2030. METHODS: Statistical modelling for 5-year age groups up to 2030 distinguishing among Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source (survival model), non-Dutch patients (projection of the proportion of culture-positive patients among first generation immigrants) and Dutch patients infected by a non-Dutch source (fixed relation with the number of non-Dutch patients). RESULTS: The number of TB patients is expected to decline to 877 in 2030. After 2010 declines may slow due to an increase in non-Dutch TB patients. This increase cancels out the decrease of Dutch TB patients infected by a Dutch source. In 2030, 85{\%} of all TB patients are expected to be non-Dutch. In the four largest counties and the rest of The Netherlands, this will be 89 and 76{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: The decrease in TB incidence observed over many years may stall from 2010 onwards because of an estimated increase in non-Dutch TB patients. Given their disproportionate burden, future TB-control activities should prioritize the health of first-generation immigrants. Enhanced TB control in the countries of origin and new diagnostic tests to identify those at high risk of developing active TB could help in reducing further the TB incidence in the Netherlands. Future TB-control efforts must be organized in a flexible way to be able to incorporate changing epidemiological situations.},

@article{Hohmann2013,
abstract = {While in antiquity both leprosy and tuberculosis were prevalent in Europe, leprosy declined thereafter and, simultaneously, tuberculosis prevalence increased. Since both diseases are caused by mycobacterial infections, it has been suggested that there might be a causal relationship between both epidemics. Chaussinand observed the inverse prevalence of leprosy and tuberculosis and suggested that individuals with a latent tuberculosis infection are protected from acquiring leprosy. His cross-immunity hypothesis has been countered more recently by a co-infection hypothesis. The latter suggestion, proposed by Donoghue, states that people being infected with multi-bacillary leprosy are more susceptible to tuberculosis, which leads to increased mortality from the disease. This study utilizes mathematical modeling to explore the epidemiological consequences of the co-infection hypothesis for realistically confined parameter values. While the co-infection hypothesis appears plausible at first glance, a second thought reveals that it comprises also substantial consequences for tuberculosis epidemics: if co-infection raises the mortality rate above that of purely tuberculosis infected persons, then tuberculosis might as well be eradicated by leprosy. It is the specific interplay of both increased susceptibility towards tuberculosis and increased death rate when co-infected that determines the epidemiological fate. As a result of this analysis, it is shown that there is a large parameter region where the eventual disappearance of leprosy could indeed be explained by co-infection. This parameter region is considerably larger than that predicted by the cross-immunity hypothesis. This shows that the co-infection hypothesis should be considered a significant alternative to the cross-immunity hypothesis. The time scales at which the effects of co-infection are observed depend critically on the spatial distribution of the individuals but reach epidemiologically realistic values for rather immobile individuals with local interaction.},

Among factors that hinder tuberculosis control, malnutrition and diabetes are key challenges. We review available data to describe the complex relationship between tuberculosis, diabetes, and nutritional status. Additionally, we review past trends, present burden, and available future global projections for diabetes, overweight and obesity, as well as undernutrition and food insecurity. Using a mathematical model, we estimate the potential effect of these factors on tuberculosis burden up to 2035. Great potential exists for reduction of worldwide tuberculosis burden by combination of improved prevention and care of diabetes with reduction of undernutrition. To achieve this combination will require joint efforts and strong cross-programme links, enabling synergistic effects of public health policies that promote good nutrition and optimum clinical care for tuberculosis and diabetes.},

abstract = {Adherence to therapy in patients with tuberculosis (TB) is a major determinant of their outcomes. Unfortunately, there are no currently known predictors of adherence, given that this phenomenon represents a complex, task-specific behavior. Notwithstanding criticisms from civil liberty advocates, directly observed therapy (DOT), facilitated by education, holistic care, enablers and incentives, is still the best strategy to ensure patient adherence to treatment. To enhance delivery of DOT, short-course chemotherapy (SCC) must be strongly advocated. Monitoring of patient progress, dependable drug supply, and adequate programme funding are other important elements of the entire strategy. Indeed, since the global resurgence of TB and associated rampant drug resistance in the 1990s, directly observed therapy, short-course (DOTS) has now become the WHO strategy for effective TB control. Data obtained so far in different continents worldwide have underscored the unrivalled efficacy of DOTS in ensuring treatment success and preventing development of acquired drug resistance. The recent WHO/International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (IUATLD) global project on anti-TB drug resistance surveillance has also revealed that countries in which {\textgreater}33-90{\%} of the population has access to the WHO DOTS strategy have, as a group, lower levels of drug resistance: primary multidrug-resistant (MDR) (1.4{\%}; median) and acquired MDR index (0. 6; median). The use of SCC was also inversely associated with the prevalence of combined resistance to any drug. Countries with MDR rates {\textgreater}2{\%} reported using SCC in a median of 70{\%} of their patients, compared with 100{\%} in countries with MDR rates {\textless}2{\%} (WHO/TB/97.229). Despite greater initial cost, DOTS is a more cost-effective strategy than self-administered therapy because it decreases the re-treatment costs associated with therapy failure and acquired drug resistance. Finally, in addition to harnessing the complementary roles of a national tuberculosis programme and community participation, DOTS might be further enhanced by the use of newly developed drugs with a long duration of action or more potent bactericidal and sterilizing activities.},

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis has an unusual natural history in that the vast majority of its human hosts enter a latent state that is both non-infectious and devoid of any symptoms of disease. From the pathogen perspective, it seems counterproductive to relinquish reproductive opportunities to achieve a detente with the host immune response. However, a small fraction of latent infections reactivate to the disease state. Thus, latency has been argued to provide a safe harbour for future infections which optimizes the persistence of M. tuberculosis in human populations. Yet, if a pathogen begins interactions with humans as an active disease without latency, how could it begin to evolve latency properties without incurring an immediate reproductive disadvantage? We address this question with a mathematical model. Results suggest that the emergence of tuberculosis latency may have been enabled by a mechanism akin to cryptic genetic variation in that detrimental latency properties were hidden from natural selection until their expression became evolutionarily favoured.},

abstract = {Background: The increasing rates of multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB) have posed the question of whether control programs under enhanced directly observed treatment, short-course (DOTS-Plus) are sufficient or implemented optimally. Despite enhanced efforts on early case detection and improved treatment regimens, direct transmission of MDR-TB remains a major hurdle for global TB control. Methods: We developed an agent-based simulation model of TB dynamics to evaluate the effect of transmission reduction measures on the incidence of MDR-TB. We implemented a 15-day isolation period following the start of treatment in active TB cases. The model was parameterized with the latest estimates derived from the published literature. Results: We found that if high rates (over 90{\%}) of TB case identification are achieved within 4 weeks of developing active TB, then a 15-day patient isolation strategy with 50{\%} effectiveness in interrupting disease transmission leads to 10{\%} reduction in the incidence of MDR-TB over 10 years. If transmission is fully prevented, the rise of MDR-TB can be halted within 10 years, but the temporal reduction of MDR-TB incidence remains below 20{\%} in this period. Conclusions: The impact of transmission reduction measures on the TB incidence depends critically on the rates and timelines of case identification. The high costs and adverse effects associated with MDR-TB treatment warrant increased efforts and investments on measures that can interrupt direct transmission through early case detection.},

abstract = {Most mathematical models used to study the epidemiology of childhood viral diseases, such as measles, describe the period of infectiousness by an exponential distribution. The effects of including more realistic descriptions of the infectious period within SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered) models are studied. Less dispersed distributions are seen to have two important epidemiological consequences. First, less stable behaviour is seen within the model: incidence patterns become more complex. Second, disease persistence is diminished: in models with a finite population, the minimum population size needed to allow disease persistence increases. The assumption made concerning the infectious period distribution is of a kind routinely made in the formulation of mathematical models in population biology. Since it has a major effect on the central issues of population persistence and dynamics, the results of this study have broad implications for mathematical modellers of a wide range of biological systems.},

Using serological survey data on rubella and mumps, Bayesian methods of model choice are applied to select the most plausible models. Estimates of the basic reproduction number R0 are derived, taking into account model uncertainty and individual heterogeneity in contact rates. Twenty-two models are documented, for which publication frequency and expert opinion are negatively correlated. Using the expert prior with individual heterogeneity, R0=6.1 [95{\%} credible region (CR) 4.3-9.2] for rubella and R0=19.3 (95{\%} CR 4.0-31.5) for mumps. The posterior modes are insensitive to the prior for rubella but not for mumps. Overall, assortative models with individual heterogeneity are recommended.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Moxifloxacin is a quinolone antimicrobial that has potent activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis. To optimize moxifloxacin dose and dose regimen, pharmacodynamic antibiotic-exposure targets associated with maximal microbial kill and complete suppression of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis must be identified. METHODS: We used a novel in vitro pharmacodynamic infection model of tuberculosis in which we exposed M. tuberculosis to moxifloxacin with a pharmacokinetic half-life of decline similar to that encountered in humans. Data obtained from this model were mathematically modeled, and the drug-exposure breakpoint associated with the suppression of drug resistance was determined. Monte-Carlo simulations were performed to determine the probability that 10,000 clinical patients taking different doses of moxifloxacin would achieve or exceed the drug-exposure breakpoint needed to suppress resistance to moxifloxacin in M. tuberculosis. RESULTS: The ratio of the moxifloxacin-free (non-protein-bound) area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h to the minimum inhibitory concentration associated with complete suppression of the drug-resistant mutant population was 53. For patients taking moxifloxacin doses of 400, 600, or 800 mg/day, the calculated target-attainment rates to suppress drug resistance were 59{\%}, 86{\%}, and 93{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSION: A moxifloxacin dose of 800 mg/day is likely to achieve excellent M. tuberculosis microbial kill and to suppress drug resistance. However, tolerability of this higher dose is still unknown.},

abstract = {The aim of the present study was to perform a cost-effectiveness analysis in young and middle-aged adults with latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in Germany. A Markov model simulated the progression of 20- and 40-yr-old close contacts of active TB cases over 20 yrs. Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid (INH) chemoprevention versus no intervention were compared. The analysis determined the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life year and the difference between numbers of TB cases and of TB-related deaths. INH chemoprevention prevented 79{\%} of expected TB cases in both age groups, and saved 9,482 and 9,142 in the lower and higher age groups, respectively, per case prevented. Quality-adjusted life expectancy was slightly extended by 8 days in the lower age group and 7 days in the higher age group, at a cost saving of 417 and 375, respectively, per person. Annual savings were 20,862 and 18,742 per 1,000 contacts, respectively. The number needed to be treated to prevent one TB case in the lower age group was 23 and 25 in the higher age group. The programme also prevented three TB-related deaths in the younger and two in the older cohort. The results are highly sensitive to treatment-cost assumptions. In conclusion, isoniazid chemoprevention in Germany is a highly cost-effective approach for reducing the burden of tuberculosis in recently converted young and middle-aged adults.},

abstract = {Background: Diseases occur in populations whose individuals differ in essential characteristics, such as exposure to the causative agent, susceptibility given exposure, and infectiousness upon infection in the case of infectious diseases. Discussion: Concepts developed in demography more than 30 years ago assert that variability between individuals affects substantially the estimation of overall population risk from disease incidence data. Methods that ignore individual heterogeneity tend to underestimate overall risk and lead to overoptimistic expectations for control. Concerned that this phenomenon is frequently overlooked in epidemiology, here we feature its significance for interpreting global data on human tuberculosis and predicting the impact of control measures. Summary: We show that population-wide interventions have the greatest impact in populations where all individuals face an equal risk. Lowering variability in risk has great potential to increase the impact of interventions. Reducing inequality, therefore, empowers health interventions, which in turn improves health, further reducing inequality, in a virtuous circle.},

abstract = {Since 1927 and until recently, most models describing the spread of disease have been of compartmental type, based on the assumption that populations are homogeneous and well-mixed. Recent models have utilised agent-based models and complex networks to explicitly study heterogeneous interaction patterns, but this leads to an increasing computational complexity. Compartmental models are appealing because of their simplicity, but their parameters, especially the transmission rate, are complex and depend on a number of factors, which makes it hard to predict how a change of a single environmental, demographic, or epidemiological factor will affect the population. Therefore, in this contribution we propose a middle ground, utilising crowd-behaviour research to improve compartmental models in crowded situations. We show how both the rate of infection as well as the walking speed depend on the local crowd density around an infected individual. The combined effect is that the rate of infection at a population scale has an analytically tractable non-linear dependency on crowd density. We model the spread of a hypothetical disease in a corridor and compare our new model with a typical compartmental model, which highlights the regime in which current models may not produce credible results.},

The time-dependent uncertainty analysis enabled us to evaluate the variability in the epidemiological outcome variables of the model during the progression of a tuberculosis epidemic. Calculated values (from the uncertainty analysis) for the disease incidence, disease prevalence, and mortality rates were approximately consistent with historical data. The time-dependent sensitivity analysis revealed that only a few of the model's input parameters significantly affected the severity of a tuberculosis epidemic; these parameters were the disease reactivation rate, the fraction of infected individuals who develop tuberculosis soon after infection, the number of individuals that an infectious individual infects per year, the disease death rate, and the population recruitment rate. Our analysis demonstrates that it is possible to improve our understanding of the behavior of tuberculosis epidemics by applying time-dependent uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to a transmission model.},

abstract = {AIMS: To determine whether tuberculosis is increasing in frequency and to explore the association between deprivation, ethnicity, and tuberculosis in the city of Leeds. METHODS: Descriptive epidemiology and ecological analysis of a register of children and young people (0-18 years) diagnosed with tuberculosis from 1982 to 1997 in Leeds Health Authority. RESULTS: A total of 107 children were identified, 61 through contact tracing, to give an age and sex standardised incidence rate of 3.9 per 100 000 per year. Rates decreased over the 16 year study period by an estimated 6.6{\%} per year. The disease was more common in girls (56{\%}) and most frequent in 5-9 year olds, with respiratory disease accounting for the largest proportion (82{\%}). Children of south Asian origin (35{\%}) had a crude incidence rate of 25.7 per 100 000 per year. The female:male ratios differed notably between south Asian (1.9:1) and non-south Asian children (1.02:1). For all subjects, univariate analyses showed significant positive associations between incidence and deprivation, population density, and ethnicity. There were no significant associations between deprivation, population density, and ethnicity and incidence of tuberculosis in south Asian children. For non-south Asian, mainly white children, only deprivation was significant. The proportion of non-south Asian children in the population was the overriding factor influencing incidence of tuberculosis. CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis remains an uncommon disease in Leeds children. An unexpected finding was a relatively higher incidence in Asian girls compared to boys. Overall, ethnicity explains a high proportion of disease independently of deprivation and population density but for non-south Asian Leeds children the strongest risk factor is deprivation.},

abstract = {Hubbell's neutral model is increasingly applied in both theoretical and empirical studies but so far little attention has been paid to the ecological mechanisms that determine species diversity in neutral communities. In this contribution we use a stochastic individual-based Markovian model to provide an explicit derivation of Hubbell's local community model from the fundamental processes of reproduction, mortality, and immigration, and show that such derivation provides important insights on the mechanisms regulating species diversity that cannot be obtained from the original model and its previous extensions. One important insight is that the basic parameters of Hubbell's model, community size (J) and the probability that a dying individual will be replaced by an immigrant (m), cannot be considered independent and that their interdependency leads to a counterintuitive trade-off between community size and species diversity. We further demonstrate that Hubbell's treatment of community size as a free parameter hides fundamental mechanisms that influence species diversity through their effect on the size of the community. For example, while in Hubbell's model immigration can only increase species diversity by promoting colonization rates, the demographic derivation shows that immigration can also promote species diversity by reducing extinction rates. Our demographic derivation also unifies previous contrasting predictions about the effect of reproduction on species diversity by showing that both positive and negative effects are possible, and that the balance between the two effects depends on the size of the community. The demographic derivation also reconciles an apparent contradiction between Hubbell's theory and patch occupancy theory, and integrates three previously proposed mechanisms of species diversity, the More Individuals Hypothesis, the rescue effect, and the dilution effect, within a single, unified framework. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A combination of continuous and categorical tests, none of which is a gold standard, is often available for classification of subject status in epidemiologic studies. For example, tuberculosis (TB) molecular epidemiology uses select mycobacterial DNA sequences to provide clues about which cases of active TB are likely clustered, implying recent transmission between these cases, versus reactivation of previously acquired infection. The proportion of recently transmitted cases is important to public health, as different control methods are implemented as transmission rates increase. Standard typing methods include IS6110 restriction fragment length polymorphism (IS6110 RFLP), but recently developed polymerase chain reaction based genotyping modalities, including mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable-number tandem repeat and spoligotyping provide quicker results. In addition, it has recently been suggested that results from IS6110 RFLP can be used to create a continuous measure of genetic relatedness, called the nearest genetic distance. Whichever method is used, estimation of cluster rates is rendered difficult by the lack of a gold standard method for classifying cases as clustered or not. Since many of these methods are relatively new, their properties have not been extensively investigated. Misclassification errors subsequently lead to sub-optimal estimation of risk factors for clustering. Here we show how Bayesian latent class models can be used in such situations, for example to simultaneously analyse Mycobacterium tuberculosis DNA data from all three of the above methods. Using the data collected at the Public Health Unit in Montreal, we estimate the proportion of clustered cases and the operating characteristics of each method using information from all three methods combined, including both continuous and dichotomous measures from IS6110 RFLP. A misclassification-adjusted regression model provides estimates of the effects of risk factors on the clustering probabilities. We also discuss how one must carefully interpret any inferences that arise from a combination of continuous and dichotomous tests.},

abstract = {Background: Selective immunisation is an alternative to universal vaccination if children at increased risk of disease can be identified. Within the Norwegian Childhood Immunisation Programme, BCG vaccine against tuberculosis and vaccine against hepatitis B virus (HBV) are offered only to children with parents from countries with high burden of the respective disease. We wanted to study whether this selective immunisation policy reaches the targeted groups. Methods: The study population was identified through the Norwegian Central Population Registry and consisted of all children born in Norway 2007-2010 and residing in Norway until their second birthday, in total 240,484 children. Information on vaccinations from the Norwegian Immunisation Registry, and on parental country of birth from Statistics Norway, was linked to the population registry by personal identifiers. The coverage of BCG and HBV vaccine was compared with the coverage of vaccines in the universal programme. Results: Among the study population, 16.1{\%} and 15.9{\%} belonged to the target groups for BCG and HBV vaccine, respectively. Among children in the BCG target group the BCG vaccine coverage was lower than the coverage of pertussis and measles vaccine (83.6{\%} vs. 98.6{\%} and 92.3{\%}, respectively). Likewise, the HBV vaccine coverage was lower than the coverage of pertussis and measles vaccine in the HBV target group (90.0{\%} vs. 98.6{\%} and 92.3{\%}, respectively). The coverage of the targeted vaccines was highest among children with parents from South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. The coverage of vaccines in the universal programme was similar in targeted and non-targeted groups. Conclusions: Children targeted by selective vaccination had lower coverage of the target vaccines than of vaccines in the universal programme, indicating that selective vaccination is challenging. Improved routines for identifying eligible children and delivering the target vaccines are needed. Universal vaccination of all children with these vaccines could be considered.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Prisons are recognised internationally as institutions with very high tuberculosis (TB) burdens where transmission is predominantly determined by contact between infectious and susceptible prisoners. A recent South African court case described the conditions under which prisoners awaiting trial were kept. With the use of these data, a mathematical model was developed to explore the interactions between incarceration conditions and TB control measures. METHODS: Cell dimensions, cell occupancy, lock-up time, TB incidence and treatment delays were derived from court evidence and judicial reports. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between prisoners, we estimated the current TB transmission probability within prison cells, and estimated transmission probabilities of improved levels of case finding in combination with implementation of national and international minimum standards for incarceration. RESULTS: Levels of overcrowding (230{\%}) in communal cells and poor TB case finding result in annual TB transmission risks of 90{\%} per annum. Implementing current national or international cell occupancy recommendations would reduce TB transmission probabilities by 30{\%} and 50{\%}, respectively. Improved passive case finding, modest ventilation increase or decreased lock-up time would minimally impact on transmission if introduced individually. However, active case finding together with implementation of minimum national and international standards of incarceration could reduce transmission by 50{\%} and 94{\%}, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Current conditions of detention for awaiting-trial prisoners are highly conducive for spread of drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB. Combinations of simple well-established scientific control measures should be implemented urgently.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To investigate the factors influencing the performance and cost-efficacy of periodic rounds of active case finding (ACF) for TB. METHODS: A mathematical model of TB dynamics and periodic ACF (PACF) in the HIV era, simplified by assuming constant prevalence of latent TB infection, is analyzed for features that control intervention outcome, measured as cases averted and cases found. Explanatory variables include baseline TB incidence, interval between PACF rounds, and different routine and PACF case-detection rates among HIV-infected and uninfected TB cases. FINDINGS: PACF can be cost-saving over a 10 year time frame if the cost-per-round is lower than a threshold proportional to initial incidence and cost-per-case-treated. More cases are averted at higher baseline incidence rates, when more potent PACF strategies are used, intervals between PACF rounds are shorter, and when the ratio of HIV-negative to positive TB cases detected is higher. More costly approaches, e.g. radiographic screening, can be as cost-effective as less costly alternatives if PACF case-detection is higher and/or implementation less frequent. CONCLUSION: Periodic ACF can both improve control and save medium-term health care costs in high TB burden settings. Greater costs of highly effective PACF at frequent (e.g. yearly) intervals may be offset by higher numbers of cases averted in populations with high baseline TB incidence, higher prevalence of HIV-uninfected cases, higher costs per-case-treated, and more effective routine case-detection. Less intensive approaches may still be cost-neutral or cost-saving in populations lacking one or more of these key determinants.},

Macrophages initiate a range of anti-bacterial mechanisms in response to infection, and Mtb is capable of surviving and circumventing many of these responses. We apply a computational approach to ask: what are the effects on the cellular level of these opposing interactions? The model considers the interplay between bacterial killing and the pathogen's interference with macrophage function. The results reveal an oscillating balance between host and pathogen, but the balance is transient and varies in length, indicating that stochasticity in the bacterial population or host response could contribute to the diverse incubation periods observed in exposed individuals. The model captures host and strain variation and gives new insight into host-pathogen compatibility and co-evolution.},

abstract = {This report presents detailed data on TB case notifications made to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system (ETS) in England to the end of 2014. This is a change in presentation compared with previous TB annual reports produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Public Health England (PHE), which reported detailed surveillance data for the whole of the UK. This change is consistent with the newly launched Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020 [1], and the fact that TB control activities, along with other health services, are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The one exception is the United Kingdom tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme (chapter 10), which is conducted for the whole of the UK. High-level data on TB notifications in the UK to the end of 2014, and breakdowns by country, can be found in the Official Statistic for TB, ‘Reports of cases of tuberculosis to enhanced tuberculosis surveillance systems: United Kingdom, 2000 to 2014'. This is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-othermycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data. As part of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020, a suite of TB Strategy Monitoring Indicators have been developed (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment{\_}data/file/403231/ Collaborative{\_}TB{\_}Strategy{\_}for{\_}England{\_}2015{\_}2020{\_}.pdf). Where data for these indicators are presented in this report, the indicator name is shown, and a summary table of national-level indicators is presented in Appendix V. Data for indicators which are presented at Upper Tier Local Authority can be found at http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tb-monitoring and will be updated with data for 2014 on 6th October 2015. Hyperlinks (in green) for specific indicators are also shown throughout the report where data are presented. TB data from 2000 are updated annually to take into account denotifications, late notifications and other updates. The data from the current year's report supersedes data in previous reports. Key points and recommendations This report presents detailed data on the occurrence and management of tuberculosis (TB) in England to the end of 2014, which should be used to inform the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020.  in the past three years there has been a year on year decline in the number of TB cases in England, down to 6,520 in 2014, a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 o despite this decline, the number of TB cases in England is still unacceptably high  the recent reduction in TB cases is mainly due to a reduction in cases in the nonUK born population, which make up nearly three-quarters of all TB cases in England o this reduction is likely in part to reflect recent declines in the number of migrants from high TB burden countries and the impact of pre-entry TB screening o the majority of non-UK born cases (86{\%}) are now notified more than two years after entering the UK, and are likely to be due to reactivation of latent TB infection o the roll out of latent TB testing and treatment, and further strengthening of TB services is required to ensure that the decline in non-UK born cases is sustained  there has been no downward trend in the incidence of TB in the UK born population in the past decade, with a rate of 3.9 per 100,000 in 2014 o 15{\%} of cases in the UK born population had at least one social risk factor, and 38{\%} were from minority ethnic groups  there is some evidence of a recent reduction in transmission of TB in England, with a decline in TB incidence in UK born children in the past six years o more substantial reductions in transmission will require improvements in early diagnosis, contact tracing and further improvements in treatment completion  treatment completion for drug sensitive cases has been improving over the past decade, with corresponding reductions in deaths and losses to follow-up  there has been a recent reduction in the number of new cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with 52 new cases diagnosed in 2014  nearly half of drug resistant cases with MDR/rifampicin resistant-TB (MDR/RRTB) notified in 2012 had not completed treatment by 24 months; these patients require specialised clinical management and considerable social support to achieve favourable outcomes Tuberculosis in England: 2015 report (presenting data to end of 2014) 8  the average delay from symptom onset to treatment start is unacceptably long and increasing; nearly one-third of pulmonary TB cases had a delay of more than four months in 2014 o to reduce this delay, improved awareness in affected communities and among health professionals, and improved access to high quality services are required  nearly one in ten TB cases in 2014 had at least one social risk factor, and there has been no reduction in the number of cases with social risk factors over the past five years o a higher proportion of those with social risk factors have drug resistant TB and worse TB outcomes, which highlights the added importance of tackling TB in this group, including through targeted outreach services  to achieve further reductions in TB in England over the next five years, including in new and settled migrant populations, in the UK born population, and among the most vulnerable groups, we need to build upon existing achievements and address gaps in current service provision; this will require the sustained and coordinated action of all key stakeholders, supported and overseen by the newly established TB control boards and national TB programme office},

We present a theoretical framework for assessing the intrinsic transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. We demonstrate that it takes one to several hundred years for a tuberculosis epidemic to rise, fall and reach a stable endemic level. Our results suggest that some of the decline of tuberculosis is simply due to the natural behaviour of an epidemic. Although other factors must also have contributed to the decline, these causal factors were constrained to operate within the slow response time dictated by the intrinsic dynamics.},

Despite its widespread use, it relies on adjustable parameters that vary from region to region and suffers from known analytic inconsistencies. Here we introduce a stochastic process capturing local mobility decisions that helps us analytically derive commuting and mobility fluxes that require as input only information on the population distribution. The resulting radiation model predicts mobility patterns in good agreement with mobility and transport patterns observed in a wide range of phenomena, from long-term migration patterns to communication volume between different regions. Given its parameter-free nature, the model can be applied in areas where we lack previous mobility measurements, significantly improving the predictive accuracy of most of the phenomena affected by mobility and transport processes.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a particularly aggressive microorganism and the host's defense is based on the induction of cellular immunity, in which the creation of a granulomatous structure has an important role. METHODOLOGY: We present here a new 2D cellular automata model based on the concept of a multifunctional process that includes key factors such as the chemokine attraction of the cells; the role of innate immunity triggered by natural killers; the presence of neutrophils; apoptosis and necrosis of infected macrophages; the removal of dead cells by macrophages, which induces the production of foamy macrophages (FMs); the life cycle of the bacilli as a determinant for the evolution of infected macrophages; and the immune response. RESULTS: The results obtained after the inclusion of two degrees of tolerance to the inflammatory response triggered by the infection shows that the model can cover a wide spectrum, ranging from highly-tolerant (i.e. mice) to poorly-tolerant hosts (i.e. mini-pigs or humans). CONCLUSIONS: This model suggest that stopping bacillary growth at the onset of the infection might be difficult and the important role played by FMs in bacillary drainage in poorly-tolerant hosts together with apoptosis and innate lymphocytes. It also shows the poor ability of the cellular immunity to control the infection, provides a clear protective character to the granuloma, due its ability to attract a sufficient number of cells, and explains why an already infected host can be constantly reinfected.},

abstract = {Neutral models of community dynamics are a powerful tool for ecological research, but their applications are currently limited to unrealistically simple types of dynamics and ignore much of the complexity that characterize natural ecosystems. Here, we present a new analytical framework for neutral models that unifies existing models of neutral communities and extends the applicability of existing models to a much wider spectrum of ecological phenomena. The new framework extends the concept of neutrality to fitness equivalence and in spite of its simplicity explains a wide spectrum of empirical patterns of species diversity including positive, negative and unimodal productivity-diversity relationships; gradual and highly delayed declines in species diversity with habitat loss; and positive and negative responses of species diversity to habitat heterogeneity. Surprisingly, the abundance distribution in all of these cases is given by the dispersal limited multinomial (DLM), the abundance distribution in Hubbell's zero-sum model, showing DLM's robustness and demonstrating that it cannot be used to infer the underlying community dynamics. These results support the hypothesis that ecological communities are regulated by a limited set of fundamental mechanisms much simpler than could be expected from their immense complexity.},

abstract = {SETTING: The seasonality of tuberculosis (TB) incidence suggests that the risk of infection or development of disease has a seasonal component.OBJECTIVE: To investigate factors associated with seasonal patterns of TB disease in the Netherlands by splitting notifications according to origin (natives vs. non-natives) and disease site (pulmonary TB [PTB] vs. extra-pulmonary TB [EPTB]). We focus on the presence of a seasonal peak, as much debate has centred on factors enhancing transmission vs. disease development.DESIGN: Monthly notifications were derived from culture sample dates of all cases between 1993 and 2008. We fitted seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) models to the time series. Seasonal decomposition revealed seasonal trends. To assess the seasonality of the peak, we repeated the analysis omitting December (trough) notifications.RESULTS: TB notifications show a seasonal pattern, with a peak in spring and a trough in winter, which is present in both PTB and EPTB and in both natives and non-natives. However, when excluding December notifications, seasonality only holds in non-native EPTB and non-native TB notifications.CONCLUSION: A seasonal peak in TB notifications (March-June) is apparent in non-natives, but is absent in natives. This peak is driven by the seasonality of EPTB notifications, which are highest in June-July. The contribution of winter crowding is discussed. Vitamin D deficiency, enhancing disease development at the end of winter-early spring, seems the most likely factor explaining the yearly peak in EPTB.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the synergistic interaction between HIV and mycobacterium tuberculosis using a deterministic model, which incorporates many of the essential biological and epidemiological features of the two dis- eases. In the absence of TB infection, the model (HIV-only model) is shown to have a globally asymptotically stable, disease-free equilibrium whenever the associated reproduction number is less than unity and has a unique endemic equilibrium whenever this number exceeds unity. On the other hand, the model with TB alone (TB-only model) undergoes the phenomenon of back- ward bifurcation, where the stable disease-free equilibrium co-exists with a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction threshold is less than unity. The analysis of the respective reproduction thresholds shows that the use of a targeted HIV treatment (using anti-retroviral drugs) strategy can lead to effective control of HIV provided it reduces the relative infectiousness of individuals treated (in comparison to untreated HIV-infected individuals) below a certain threshold. The full model, with both HIV and TB, is simulated to evaluate the impact of the various treatment strategies. It is shown that the HIV-only treatment strategy saves more cases of the mixed infection than the TB-only strategy. Further, for low treatment rates, the mixed-only strategy saves the least number of cases (of HIV, TB, and the mixed infection) in comparison to the other strategies. Thus, this study shows that if resources are limited, then targeting such resources to treating one of the diseases is more beneficial in reducing new cases of the mixed infection than targeting the mixed infection only diseases. Finally, the universal strategy saves more cases of the mixed infection than any of the other strategies.},

We hypothesized that immune modulating co-infections such as helminths, malaria, and HIV increase susceptibility to latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), thereby contributing to maintaining the tuberculosis epidemic.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: Adults with sputum-positive tuberculosis (index cases) and their eligible household contacts (HHCs) were recruited to a cohort study between May 2011 and January 2012. HHCs were investigated for helminths, malaria, and HIV at enrolment. HHCs were tested using the QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube (QFN) assay at enrolment and six months later. Overnight whole blood culture supernatants from baseline QFN assays were analyzed for cytokine responses using an 11-plex Luminex assay. Associations between outcomes (LTBI or cytokine responses) and exposures (co-infections and other risk factors) were examined using multivariable logistic and linear regression models.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: We enrolled 101 index cases and 291 HHCs. Among HHCs, baseline prevalence of helminths was 9{\%} (25/291), malaria 16{\%} (47/291), HIV 6{\%} (16/291), and LTBI 65{\%} (179/277). Adjusting for other risk factors and household clustering, there was no association between LTBI and any co-infection at baseline or at six months: adjusted odds ratio (95{\%} confidence interval (CI); p-value) at baseline for any helminth, 1.01 (0.39-2.66; 0.96); hookworm, 2.81 (0.56-14.14; 0.20); malaria, 1.06 (0.48-2.35; 0.87); HIV, 0.74 (0.22-2.47; 0.63). HHCs with LTBI had elevated cytokine responses to tuberculosis antigens but co-infections had little effect on cytokine responses. Exploring other risk factors, Th1 cytokines among LTBI-positive HHCs with BCG scars were greatly reduced compared to those without scars: (adjusted geometric mean ratio) IFN$\gamma$ 0.20 (0.09-0.42), {\textless}0.0001; IL-2 0.34 (0.20-0.59), {\textless}0.0001; and TNF$\alpha$ 0.36 (0.16-0.79), 0.01.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that co-infections increase the risk of LTBI, or influence the cytokine response profile among those with LTBI. Prior BCG exposure may reduce Th1 cytokine responses in LTBI.},

abstract = {The reemergence of tuberculosis (TB) from the 1980s to the early 1990s instigated extensive researches on the mechanisms behind the transmission dynamics of TB epidemics. This article provides a detailed review of the work on the dynamics and control of TB. The earliest mathematical models describing the TB dynamics appeared in the 1960s and focused on the prediction and control strategies using simulation approaches. Most recently developed models not only pay attention to simulations but also take care of dynamical analysis using modern knowledge of dynamical systems. Questions addressed by these models mainly concentrate on TB control strategies, optimal vaccination policies, approaches toward the elimination of TB in the U.S.A., TB co-infection with HIV/AIDS, drug-resistant TB, responses of the immune system, impacts of demography, the role of public transportation systems, and the impact of contact patterns. Model formulations involve a variety of mathematical areas, such as ODEs (Ordinary Differential Equations) (both autonomous and non-autonomous systems), PDEs (Partial Differential Equations), system of difference equations, system of integro-differential equations, Markov chain model, and simulation models.},

We developed a relative fitness-based multidrug-resistant (MDR) TB model incorporated with seasonality and a probabilistic assessment model to assess infection risk in Taiwan regions. The model accurately captures the seasonal transmission and population dynamics of TB incidence during 2006-2008 and MDR TB in high TB burden areas during 2006-2010 in Taiwan. There is {\~{}}3{\%} probability of having exceeded 50{\%} of the population infected attributed to MDR TB. Our model not only provides insight into the understanding of the interactions between seasonal dynamics of TB and environmental factors but is also capable of predicting the seasonal patterns of TB incidence associated with MDR TB infection risk. A better understanding of the mechanisms of TB seasonality will be critical in predicting the impact of public control programmes.},

abstract = {The resurgence of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis in some parts of Europe and North America calls for a mathematical study to assess the impact of the emergence and spread of such strain on the global effort to effectively control the burden of tuberculosis. This paper presents a deterministic compartmental model for the transmission dynamics of two strains of tuberculosis, a drug-sensitive (wild) one and a multi-drug-resistant strain. The model allows for the assessment of the treatment of people infected with the wild strain. The qualitative analysis of the model reveals the following. The model has a disease-free equilibrium, which is locally asymptotically stable if a certain threshold, known as the effective reproduction number, is less than unity. Further, the model undergoes a backward bifurcation, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with a stable endemic equilibrium. One of the main novelties of this study is the numerical illustration of tri-stable equilibria, where the disease-free equilibrium coexists with two stable endemic equilibrium when the aforementioned threshold is less than unity, and a bi-stable setup, involving two stable endemic equilibria, when the effective reproduction number is greater than one. This, to our knowledge, is the first time such dynamical features have been observed in TB dynamics. Finally, it is shown that the backward bifurcation phenomenon in this model arises due to the exogenous re-infection property of tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) was thought to be safely in decline in the United States in the mid-1980s because the number of cases had dropped by 74{\%} between 1953 and 1985. An increase in TB cases was reported, however, in 1986, and an upward trend in TB incidence has continued. The turnaround in TB is well correlated with the rise of the HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) epidemic. The purpose of this work is to investigate, through the use of mathematical models, the magnitude and duration of the effect that the HIV epidemic may have on TB. Models are developed which reflect the transmission dynamics of both TB and HIV, and the relative merits of these models are discussed. The models are then linked together to form a model for the combined spread of both diseases. A numerical study is performed to investigate the influence of certain key parameters. The effect that HIV will have on the general population is found to be dependent on the contact structure between the general population and the HIV risk groups, as well as a possible shift in the dynamics associated with TB transmission.},

abstract = {The study evaluates the economic costs and benefits of improving tuberculosis control interventions in Thailand. Provider costs are determined on the basis of marginal treatment costs for varying case numbers and estimates of the cost of required infrastructure changes. Indirect costs are calculated as income lost due to morbidity and premature mortality. An epidemiological model is used to calculate case numbers and mortality under current control conditions and a scenario of improved control. An improved control strategy initially leads to a higher number of detected cases. For longer projection periods, the epidemiological impact of curing a higher proportion of infectious sources results in lower case numbers than those expected without programme improvement. Model simulations show a reduction of total annual case numbers through improved control measures by an average 45{\%} after a simulation period of 20 years. The corresponding societal savings in form of reduced indirect costs from the disease are U.S.{\$}2.4 billion. Reductions in direct provider costs can be expected as a result of decreased numbers of detected cases for longer evaluation periods, as well as a lower proportion of multi-drug-resistant cases. The mean value of predicted savings is U.S.{\$}8.3 million. Since this value is likely to be higher than the required investment in improved infrastructure, net savings can be expected. The result of an uncertainty analysis shows a wide range of potential additional costs or net savings with respect to direct provider costs. Indirect cost calculations show net savings for all parameter values.},

Their method involves simulating epidemics from various infectious disease models, and using classifiers built from the epidemic curve data to predict which model were most likely to have generated observed epidemic curves. They showed that the classification approach could fairly identify underlying characteris- tics of the disease system, without fitting various transmission models via, say, Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo. We extend this work to the case where the underlying infec- tious disease model is inherently spatial. Our goal is to compare the use of global epidemic curves for building the classifier, with the use of spatially stratified epidemic curves. We demonstrate these methods on simu- lated data and apply the method to analyze a tomato spotted wilt virus epidemic dataset.},

For the basic model, we present new analysis on the existence and stability of equilibria. Then, we use numerical simulations of the model to illustrate the behavior of the system. We apply the model to Canadian reported data on tuberculosis and observe a good agreement between the model prediction and the data. For the extended model, which incorporated the recruitment of the latent and infectious in immigrants to the basic model, we find that the usual threshold condition does not apply and a unique equilibrium exists for all parameter values. This indicates that the disease does not disappear and becomes endemic in host areas. This finding is also supported by numerical simulations with the extended model. Our study suggests that immigrants have a considerable influence on the overall transmission dynamics behavior of tuberculosis.},

DESIGN: Decision analysis with Monte Carlo simulation of a Markov decision tree. DATA SOURCES: People with smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis. DATA ANALYSIS: Analyses modelled different levels of programme effectiveness of DOTS and DOTS-plus, and high (10{\%}) and intermediate (3{\%}) proportions of primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, while accounting for exogenous reinfection. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The cumulative number of tuberculosis deaths per 100 000 population over 10 years. RESULTS: The model predicted that under DOTS, 276 people would die from tuberculosis (24 multidrug resistant and 252 not multidrug resistant) over 10 years under optimal implementation in an area with 3{\%} primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis. Optimal implementation of DOTS-plus would result in four (1.5{\%}) fewer deaths. If implementation of DOTS-plus were to result in a decrease of just 5{\%} in the effectiveness of DOTS, 16{\%} more people would die with tuberculosis than under DOTS alone. In an area with 10{\%} primary multidrug resistant tuberculosis, 10{\%} fewer deaths would occur under optimal DOTS-plus than under optimal DOTS, but 16{\%} more deaths would occur if implementation of DOTS-plus were to result in a 5{\%} decrease in the effectiveness of DOTS CONCLUSIONS: Under optimal implementation, fewer tuberculosis deaths would occur under DOTS-plus than under DOTS. If, however, implementation of DOTS-plus were associated with even minimal decreases in the effectiveness of treatment, substantially more patients would die than under DOTS.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Indian guidelines recommend routine referral for HIV testing of all tuberculosis (TB) patients in the nine states with the highest HIV prevalence, and selective referral for testing elsewhere. We assessed the clinical impact and cost-effectiveness of alternative HIV testing referral strategies among TB patients in India. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We utilized a computer model of HIV and TB disease to project outcomes for patients with active TB in India. We compared life expectancy, cost, and cost-effectiveness for three HIV testing referral strategies: 1) selective referral for HIV testing of those with increased HIV risk, 2) routine referral of patients in the nine highest HIV prevalence states with selective referral elsewhere (current standard), and 3) routine referral of all patients for HIV testing. TB-related data were from the World Health Organization. HIV prevalence among TB patients was 9.0{\%} in the highest prevalence states, 2.9{\%} in the other states, and 4.9{\%} overall. The selective referral strategy, beginning from age 33.50 years, had a projected discounted life expectancy of 16.88 years and a mean lifetime HIV/TB treatment cost of US{\$}100. The current standard increased mean life expectancy to 16.90 years with additional per-person cost of US{\$}10; the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US{\$}650/year of life saved (YLS) compared to selective referral. Routine referral of all patients for HIV testing increased life expectancy to 16.91 years, with an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US{\$}730/YLS compared to the current standard. For HIV-infected patients cured of TB, receiving antiretroviral therapy increased survival from 4.71 to 13.87 years. Results were most sensitive to the HIV prevalence and the cost of second-line antiretroviral therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Referral of all patients with active TB in India for HIV testing will be both effective and cost-effective. While effective implementation of this strategy would require investment, routine, voluntary HIV testing of TB patients in India should be recommended.},

Typical examples might include screening of tuberculosis in urban ghetto areas, venereal diseases in the sexually active, or AIDS in high risk population groups. The model is addressed to diseases which have zero or negligible latent periods. In the model, it is assumed that the reliabilities of the screening tests are constant, and independent of how long the population unit has the disease. Both tests with perfect and imperfect reliabilities are considered. It is shown that most of the results of a 1978 study by W.P. Pierskalla and J.A. Voelker for noncontagious diseases can be generalized for contagious diseases. A mathematical program for computing the optimal test choice and screening periods is presented. It is shown that the optimal screening schedule is equally spaced for tests with perfect reliability. Other properties relating to the managerial problems of screening frequencies, test selection, and resource allocation are also presented.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the progress made in the past decade, tuberculosis (TB) control still faces significant challenges. In many countries with declining TB incidence, the disease tends to concentrate in vulnerable populations that often have limited access to health care. In light of the limitations of the current case-finding approach and the global urgency to improve case detection, active case-finding (ACF) has been suggested as an important complementary strategy to accelerate tuberculosis control especially among high-risk populations. The present exercise aims to develop a model that can be used for county-level project planning. METHODS: A simple deterministic model was developed to calculate the number of estimated TB cases diagnosed and the associated costs of diagnosis. The model was designed to compare cost-effectiveness parameters, such as the cost per case detected, for different diagnostic algorithms when they are applied to different risk populations. The model was transformed into a web-based tool that can support national TB programmes and civil society partners in designing ACF activities. RESULTS: According to the model output, tuberculosis active case-finding can be a costly endeavor, depending on the target population and the diagnostic strategy. The analysis suggests the following: (1) Active case-finding activities are cost-effective only if the tuberculosis prevalence among the target population is high. (2) Extensive diagnostic methods (e.g. X-ray screening for the entire group, use of sputum culture or molecular diagnostics) can be applied only to very high-risk groups such as TB contacts, prisoners or people living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. (3) Basic diagnostic approaches such as TB symptom screening are always applicable although the diagnostic yield is very limited. The cost-effectiveness parameter was sensitive to local diagnostic costs and the tuberculosis prevalence of target populations. CONCLUSIONS: The prioritization of appropriate target populations and careful selection of cost-effective diagnostic strategies are critical prerequisites for rational active case-finding activities. A decision to conduct such activities should be based on the setting-specific cost-effectiveness analysis and programmatic assessment. A web-based tool was developed and is available to support national tuberculosis programmes and partners in the formulation of cost-effective active case-finding activities at the national and subnational levels.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB), an air-borne infectious disease, is a major public-health problem in China. The reported number of the active tuberculosis cases is about one million each year. The morbidity data for 2005-2012 reflect that the difference in morbidity based on age group is significant, thus the role of age-structure on the transmission of TB needs to be further developed. In this work, based on the reported data and the observed morbidity characteristics, we propose a susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) epidemic model with age groupings, involving three categories: children, the middle-aged, and senior to investigate the role of age on the transmission of tuberculosis in Mainland China from 2005 to 2016. Then, we evaluated the parameters by the Least Square method and simulated the model and it had good alignment with the reported infected TB data in Mainland China. Furthermore, we estimated the basic reproduction number R(0) of 1.7858, with an obtained 95{\%} confidence interval for R(0) of (1.7752, 1.7963) by Latin hypercube sampling, and we completed a sensitivity analysis of R(0) in terms of some parameters. Our study demonstrates that diverse age groups have different effects on TB. Two effective measures were found that would help reach the goals of theWorld Health Organization (WHO) End TB Strategy: an increase in the recovery rate and the reduction in the infectious rate of the senior age group.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) accounts of much of the morbidity and mortality associated with HIV. We evaluate the cost-effectiveness of different strategies to actively screen for TB disease in HIV positive individuals, where isoniazid preventative therapy (IPT) is given to those screening negative, and use value of information analysis (VOI) to identify future research priorities. METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We built an individual sampling model to investigate the costs (2010 US Dollars) and consequences of screening for TB, and providing TB treatment or IPT in adults testing HIV positive in Sub-Saharan Africa. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to assess performance of the nine different TB screening strategies evaluated. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was conducted to incorporate decision uncertainty, and expected value of perfect information for the entire model and for groups of parameters was calculated. Screening all HIV infected individuals with sputum microscopy was the least costly strategy, with other strategies not cost-effective at WHO recommended thresholds. Screening those with TB symptoms with sputum microscopy and CXR would be cost-effective at a threshold ICER of {\$}7,800 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY), but associated with significant uncertainty. VOI analysis suggests further information would be of value. CONCLUSIONS/ SIGNIFICANCE: Resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa wishing to scale up TB preventative services in their HIV infected populations should consider expanding laboratory facilities to enable increased screening for TB with sputum microscopy, whilst improved estimates of the TB prevalence in the population to be screened are needed, as it may influence the optimal strategy.},

abstract = {We examined long-term surveillance data on antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 (DT104) isolates from concurrently sampled and sympatric human and animal populations in Scotland. Using novel ecological and epidemiological approaches to examine diversity, and phenotypic and temporal relatedness of the resistance profiles, we assessed the more probable source of resistance of these two populations. The ecological diversity of AMR phenotypes was significantly greater in human isolates than in animal isolates, at the resolution of both sample and population. Of 5200 isolates, there were 65 resistance phenotypes, 13 unique to animals, 30 unique to humans and 22 were common to both. Of these 22, 11 were identified first in the human isolates, whereas only five were identified first in the animal isolates. We conclude that, while ecologically connected, animals and humans have distinguishable DT104 communities, differing in prevalence, linkage and diversity. Furthermore, we infer that the sympatric animal population is unlikely to be the major source of resistance diversity for humans. This suggests that current policy emphasis on restricting antimicrobial use in domestic animals may be overly simplistic. While these conclusions pertain to DT104 in Scotland, this approach could be applied to AMR in other bacteria-host ecosystems.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the problem of modeling and parameter estimation of a deterministic model of tuberculosis (abbreviated as TB for tubercle bacillus). We first propose and analyze a tuberculosis model without seasonality that incorporates the essential biological and epidemiological features of the disease. The model is shown to exhibit the phenomenon of backward bifurcation, where a stable disease-free equilibrium coexists with one or more stable endemic equilibria when the associated basic reproduction number is less than unity. The statistical data of new TB cases show seasonal fluctuations in many countries. Then, we extend the proposed TB model by incorporating seasonality. We propose a numerical study to estimate unknown parameters according to demographic and epidemiological data in Cameroon. Simulation results are in good accordance with the seasonal variation of the reported new cases of active TB in Cameroon.},

abstract = {The pacific islands of Micronesia have experienced several outbreaks of mosquito-borne diseases over the past decade. Since these outbreaks occurred in confined island populations, their analysis can improve our understanding of the transmission dynamics of the pathogens involved, and particularly so for yet understudied pathogens such as Zika virus. Here, we compare three outbreaks of dengue and Zika virus in two different island settings in Micronesia, the Yap Main Islands and Fais, using a mathematical model of transmission dynamics, making full use of commonalities in disease and setting between the outbreaks. We found that the estimated reproduction numbers for Zika and dengue are similar when considered in the same setting, but that, conversely, reproduction number for the same disease can vary considerably by setting. On the Yap Main Islands, we estimate a mean reproduction number of 4.3 (95{\%} credible interval 3.1-6.1) for the dengue outbreak and 4.8 (2.9-8.1) for the Zika outbreak, whereas for the dengue outbreak on Fais our mean estimate is 10 (5.5-18). We further found that the ranges of most disease-specific parameters largely overlap between dengue and Zika, but that reporting rates of Zika cases are much smaller (3{\%}, 1-7) than those of dengue (68{\%}, 43-98). These results suggests that models for dengue transmission can be useful for estimating the predicted dynamics of Zika transmission, but care must be taken when extrapolating findings from one setting to another. Field studies on differences in vector density and biting exposure, as well as comparative modelling studies in other settings, could yield important further insights into the relationship between the transmission dynamics of Zika and dengue, and the specific setting in which they occur.},

abstract = {The effect of difference in susceptibility on the dynamics of tuberculosis is an ongoing study. Several genes in TB co-receptors (e.g. HLA and non-HLA) have been correlated with susceptibility and resistance to tuberculosis and rate of progression to active TB. In this paper, we present a novel mathematical model that distinguishes between susceptibility amongst the population. The model classifies the susceptibles as having no, partial or full natural resistance to tuberculosis and the latently infecteds as rapid, normal or very slow (or no) progressors to active TB depending on the genes. The goal of this paper is to investigate the impact of such heterogeneity on the spread of tuberculosis and to identify key parameters that could be used in understanding these heterogeneities more fully. We derived the reproduction number R-T for the model and examine the relative contributions to R-T from the three latently infected classes as well as the infectious classes. The effect of treatment under the heterogeneity is also examined. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Children with tuberculosis present with high rates of disseminated disease and tuberculous (TB) meningitis due to poor cell-mediated immunity. Recommended isoniazid doses vary from 5 mg/kg/day to 15 mg/kg/day. Antimicrobial pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies have demonstrated that the ratio of the 0- to 24-h area under the concentration-time curve (AUC(0-24)) to the MIC best explains isoniazid microbial kill. The AUC(0-24)/MIC ratio associated with 80{\%} of maximal kill (80{\%} effective concentration [EC(80)]), considered the optimal effect, is 287.2. Given the pharmacokinetics of isoniazid encountered in children 10 years old or younger, with infants as a special group, and given the differences in penetration of isoniazid into phagocytic cells, epithelial lining fluid, and subarachnoid space during TB meningitis, we performed 10,000 patient Monte Carlo simulations to determine how well isoniazid doses of between 2.5 and 40 mg/kg/day would achieve or exceed the EC(80). None of the doses examined achieved the EC(80) in {\textgreater}/=90{\%} of children. Doses of 5 mg/kg were universally inferior; doses of 10 to 15 mg/kg/day were adequate only under the very limited circumstances of children who were slow acetylators and had disease limited to pneumonia. Each of the three disease syndromes, acetylation phenotype, and being an infant required different doses to achieve adequate AUC(0-24)/MIC exposures in an acceptable proportion of children. We conclude that current recommended doses for children are likely suboptimal and that isoniazid doses in children are best individualized based on disease process, age, and acetylation status.},

In this paper we use a paradigm model to show that environmental transmission appears like direct transmission in the case where the pathogen persists little time in the environment. Furthermore, we formulate conditions for the validity of this modeling approximation and we illustrate them numerically for the cases of cholera and influenza. According to our results based on recently published parameter estimates, the direct transmission approximation fails for both cholera and influenza.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Culture of Mycobacterium tuberculosis currently represents the closest "gold standard" for diagnosis of tuberculosis (TB), but operational data are scant on the impact and cost-effectiveness of TB culture for human immunodeficiency (HIV-) infected individuals in resource-limited settings. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We recorded costs, laboratory results, and dates of initiating TB therapy in a centralized TB culture program for HIV-infected patients in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, constructing a decision-analysis model to estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of TB culture from the perspective of a public-sector TB control program. Of 217 TB suspects presenting between January 2006 and March 2008, 33 (15{\%}) had culture-confirmed active tuberculosis; 23 (70{\%}) were smear-negative. Among smear-negative, culture-positive patients, 6 (26{\%}) began TB therapy before culture results were available, 11 (48{\%}) began TB therapy after culture result availability, and 6 (26{\%}) did not begin TB therapy within 180 days of presentation. The cost per negative culture was US{\$}17.52 (solid media)-{\$}23.50 (liquid media). Per 1,000 TB suspects and compared with smear alone, TB culture with solid media would avert an estimated eight TB deaths (95{\%} simulation interval [SI]: 4, 15) and 37 disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) (95{\%} SI: 13, 76), at a cost of {\$}36 (95{\%} SI: {\$}25, {\$}50) per TB suspect or {\$}962 (95{\%} SI: {\$}469, {\$}2642) per DALY averted. Replacing solid media with automated liquid culture would avert one further death (95{\%} SI: -1, 4) and eight DALYs (95{\%} SI: -4, 23) at {\$}2751 per DALY (95{\%} SI: {\$}680, dominated). The cost-effectiveness of TB culture was more sensitive to characteristics of the existing TB diagnostic system than to the accuracy or cost of TB culture. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: TB culture is potentially effective and cost-effective for HIV-positive patients in resource-constrained settings. Reliable transmission of culture results to patients and integration with existing systems are essential.},

abstract = {The study of biological systems commonly depends on inferring the state of a 'hidden' variable, such as an underlying genotype, from that of an 'observed' variable, such as an expressed phenotype. However, this cannot be achieved using traditional quantitative methods when more than one genetic mechanism exists for a single observable phenotype. Using a novel latent class Bayesian model, it is possible to infer the prevalence of different genetic elements in a population given a sample of phenotypes. As an exemplar, data comprising phenotypic resistance to six antimicrobials obtained from passive surveillance of Salmonella Typhimurium DT104 are analysed to infer the prevalence of individual resistance genes, as well as the prevalence of a genomic island known as SGI1 and its variants. Three competing models are fitted to the data and distinguished between using posterior predictive p-values to assess their ability to predict the observed number of unique phenotypes. The results suggest that several SGI1 variants circulate in a few fixed forms through the population from which our data were derived. The methods presented could be applied to other types of phenotypic data, and represent a useful and generic mechanism of inferring the genetic population structure of organisms.},

@article{Lipsitch2002a,
abstract = {The need to stem the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance has prompted multiple, sometimes con-flicting, calls for changes in the use of antimicrobial agents. One source of disagreement concerns the major mechanisms by which antibiotics select resistant strains. For infections like tuberculosis, in which resistance can emerge in treated hosts through mutation, prevention of antimicrobial resistance in individ-ual hosts is a primary method of preventing the spread of resistant organisms in the community. By con-trast, for many other important resistant pathogens, such as penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium resistance is mediated by the acquisition of genes or gene fragments by horizontal transfer; resis-tance in the treated host is a relatively rare event. For these organisms, indirect, population-level mecha-nisms of selection account for the increase in the prevalence of resistance. These mechanisms can operate even when treatment has a modest, or even negative, effect on an individual host's colonization with resistant organisms. he growth of antimicrobial resistance has prompted calls to reduce unnecessary antibiotic use and to improve treat-ment protocols to maximize the lifespan of these drugs. These calls rest on the well-supported idea that the use of antimicro-bial agents is a powerful selective force that promotes the emergence of resistant strains. To reduce antimicrobial resistance, multiple, and often conflicting recommendations, have been made. For example, strategies to minimize the burden of resistance in hospitals have included reduction of all antimicrobial classes, increased use of prophylactic antimicrobials to reduce colonization, rota-tion of different antibiotic classes in a temporal sequence, and simultaneous use of different antimicrobials for different patients (1-6). Underlying these often varying recommendations for improving antimicrobial use is frequently conflicting evidence about the relationship between antibiotic treatment and antibi-otic resistance. In some pathogens, showing that antibiotic treat-ment puts treated persons at a greater risk for acquiring resistant organisms has been difficult (7-8); nonetheless, the cumulative effect of using these antibiotics has clearly been to increase the prevalence of resistance in the population as a whole. For many pathogens of current concern, especially organ-isms for which asymptomatic colonization typically precedes infection (e.g., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus spp., and the gram-negative enteric bac-teria), the relationship between antimicrobial use and resis-tance differs in fundamental ways from the relationship found in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, for which many modern prin-ciples of chemotherapy were developed. Furthermore, we argue that the selective effects of antibiotic use on these},

To investigate this issue, a large series of MDR- and XDR-TB cases diagnosed in Estonia, Germany, Italy and the Russian Federation (Archangels Oblast) between 1999 and 2006 were analysed. All study sites performed drug susceptibility testing for first- and second-line anti-TB drugs, laboratory quality assurance and treatment delivery according to World Health Organization recommendations. Out of 4,583 culture-confirmed cases, 240 MDR- and 48 XDR-TB cases had a definitive outcome recorded (treatment success, death, failure). Among MDR- and XDR-TB cases, capreomycin resistance yielded a higher proportion of failure and death than capreomycin-susceptible cases. Resistance to capreomycin was independently associated with unfavourable outcome (logistic regression analysis: odds ratio 3.51). In the treatment of patients with multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis, resistance to the injectable drug capreomycin was an independent predictor for therapy failure in this cohort. As Mycobacterium tuberculosis drug resistance is increasing worldwide, there is an urgent need for novel interventions in the fight against tuberculosis.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To determine whether elimination of tuberculosis in the Dutch population can be achieved by the year 2030, taking into account the impact of immigration. METHODS: The incidence of tuberculosis (all forms) in the period 1970 to 2030 was estimated using a life-table model for the Dutch population without the impact of immigration. The influence of immigration on tuberculosis incidence among the Dutch was modelled using four immigrant scenarios, distinguished by the assumed contact rate between immigrants and the Dutch population, and by different projections (middle, upper) of the future size of the immigrant population in The Netherlands. RESULTS: The incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis among the Dutch is projected to be 1.4 per million in the scenario without the influence of immigrant cases, and ranging from 3.8 to 11.8 per million in the four immigrant scenarios. In all immigrant scenarios, the prevalence of tuberculosis infection will continue to decline and be less than 1{\%} by the year 2030. At least 60{\%} of Dutch tuberculosis cases in the year 2030 are expected to be the result of transmission from a foreign source case. CONCLUSION: Using a prevalence of tuberculosis infection of less than 1{\%} as the elimination criterion, tuberculosis will probably be eliminated from the indigenous Dutch population by 2030. However, the incidence of smear-positive tuberculosis is expected to remain higher than 1 per million, and the majority of new tuberculosis cases among the Dutch may be attributable to recent infection from a foreign source case.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Contacts of patients with active tuberculosis ("TB contacts") with a tuberculin skin test (TST) size {\textgreater} or = 5 mm are currently recommended treatment for latent TB infection (LTBI). Knowing the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy for specific TB contact subpopulations may improve the use of limited resources by reducing the treatment of persons at low TB risk. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI therapy for different TB contact populations defined by important risk factors, and to propose an optimal policy based on different recommendation for each subgroup of contacts. METHODS: A 6-year Markov decision analytic model simulating the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs), number of active TB cases prevented, and costs for hypothetical cohorts of Canadian TB contacts defined by TST size, age group ({\textless} 10 y/o or above), ethnicity, closeness of contact, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccination status. RESULTS: For the majority of subgroups, the current policy of preventive therapy in those with positive TST was the most cost-effective. Nevertheless, our analysis determined that LTBI treatment is not cost-effective in nonhousehold Canadian-born (nonaboriginal) or foreign-born contacts age {\textgreater} or = 10 y/o. On the other hand, empirical treatment without screening of all non-BCG-vaccinated household contacts age {\textless} 10 y/o appeared cost-effective. Such an optimal approach would result in an incremental net monetary benefit of {\$}25 for each contact investigated for a willingness-to-pay of {\$}50,000/QALY. Results were robust to several alternative assumptions considered in sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSIONS: The current practice of LTBI treatment for TB contacts with a TST size {\textgreater} or = 5 mm is cost-effective. A customized approach based on excluding low risk groups from screening and providing treatment to high risk contacts without screening could improve the performance of the program.},

abstract = {Background: Several diseases, many of which nowadays pandemic, consist of multifactorial pathologies. Paradigmatic examples come from the immune response to pathogens, in which cases the effects of different infections combine together, yielding complex mutual feedback, often a positive one that boosts infection progression in a scenario that can easily become lethal. HIV is one such infection, which weakens the immune system favouring the insurgence of opportunistic infections, amongst which Tuberculosis (TB). The treatment with antiretroviral therapies has shown effective in reducing mortality. An in-depth understanding of complex systems, like the one consisting of HIV, TB and related therapies, is an open great challenge, on the boundaries of bioinformatics, computational and systems biology. Results: We present a simplified formalisation of the highly dynamic system consisting of HIV, TB and related therapies, at the cellular level. The progression of the disease (AIDS) depends hence on interactions between viruses, cells, chemokines, the high mutation rate of viruses, the immune response of individuals and the interaction between drugs and infection dynamics. We first discuss a deterministic model of dual infection (HIV and TB) which is able to capture the long-term dynamics of CD4 T cells, viruses and Tumour Necrosis Factor (TNF). We contrast this model with a stochastic approach which captures intrinsic fluctuations of the biological processes. Furthermore, we also integrate automated reasoning techniques, i.e. probabilistic model checking, in our formal analysis. Beyond numerical simulations, model checking allows general properties (effectiveness of anti-HIV therapies) to be verified against the models by means of an automated procedure. Our work stresses the growing importance and flexibility of model checking techniques in bioinformatics. In this paper we i) describe HIV as a complex case of infectious diseases; ii) provide a number of different formal descriptions that suitably account for aspects of interests; iii) suggest that the integration of different models together with automated reasoning techniques can improve the understanding of infections and therapies through formal analysis methodologies. Conclusion: We argue that the described methodology suitably supports the study of viral infections in a formal, automated and expressive manner. We envisage a long-term contribution of this kind of approaches to clinical Bioinformatics and Translational Medicine.},

Results from the survey identified four key factors that must be combined for an effective control of TB and increase the case detection rate: effective awareness programme, active cough identification, associated cost factor for treatment of identified cases and effective treatment. The overall effect of these factors on the basic reproduction number under treatment, R(T), of the TB model was considered. In all, a serious concentration on tuberculosis awareness programmes and active cough identification as a marker for someone having TB was shown to significantly reduce the value of the reproduction number, hereby reducing the severity of the disease in the presence of treatment.},

In our model, effective MDRTB and HIV control reduces cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 54{\%}, cumulative MDRTB deaths 15-fold and cumulative HIV-associated-tuberculosis-deaths 2-fold. Effective MDRTB control, without effective harm-reduction programmes, only reduce tuberculosis deaths by 22{\%}. However, effective harm-reduction programme with a poor MDRTB control reduce cumulative tuberculosis deaths by 34{\%}, MDRTB by 14{\%} and HIV-associated-tuberculosis by 56{\%}. Even with good control programmes for drug sensitive TB, neglecting harm reduction and MDRTB control will result in 50{\%} more tuberculosis-related deaths than if both are effectively addressed. Effective harm-reduction programmes reduces cumulative deaths from tuberculosis more substantively than effective MDRTB control. Our finding have important policy implications for communicable disease policies in post-Soviet countries, which need to substantially change if they are to effectively address the emerging HIV and MDRTB epidemics.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global health problem. A possible risk factor for TB is diabetes (DM), which is predicted to increase dramatically over the next two decades, particularly in low and middle income countries, where TB is widespread. This study aimed to assess the strength of the association between TB and DM. We present a deterministic model for TB in a community in order to determine the impact of DM in the spread of the disease. The important mathematical features of the TB model are thoroughly investigated. The epidemic threshold known as the basic reproduction number and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities analyzed. The model is numerically analyzed to assess the impact of DM on the transmission dynamics of TB. We perform sensitivity analysis on the key parameters that drive the disease dynamics in order to determine their relative importance to disease transmission and prevalence. Numerical simulations suggest that DM enhances the TB transmission and progression to active TB in a community. The results suggest that there is a need for increased attention to intervention strategies such as the chemoprophylaxis of TB latent individuals and treatment of active TB in people with DM, which may include testing for suspected diabetes, improved glucose control, and increased clinical and therapeutic monitoring in order to reduce the burden of the disease.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis transmission is determined by contact between infectious and susceptible individuals. A recent study reported a 4{\%} annual risk of child tuberculosis infection in a southern African township. A model was used to explore the interactions between prevalence of adult tuberculosis infection, adult-to-child contacts, and household ventilation, which could result in such a high annual risk of tuberculosis infection. METHODS: Number of residents per household and tuberculosis incidence were derived from a household census and community tuberculosis registers. Using the Wells-Riley equation and probability analyses of contact between infectious adults with tuberculosis and preschool children, we estimated the annual risk of tuberculosis infection within and outside of the home. RESULTS: There was a mean of 2.2 adults per child-containing household with a 1.35{\%} annual adult smear-positive tuberculosis notification rate. The maximal household annual risk of tuberculosis infection was 3{\%}, which was primarily determined by the number of resident adults. Transmission risk outside the home increased with increasing number of households visited. Transmission probabilities were sensitive to exposure time, ventilation, and period of adult infectivity. The benefits of increased ventilation were greatest when the period of infectivity was reduced. Similar reductions in household transmission could be achieved by increasing ventilation from 2 to 6 air changes/hour or by separating child and adult sleeping areas. CONCLUSIONS: The annual risk of tuberculosis infection of preschool children predominantly results from infectious residents in the home. However, even with limited social interactions, a substantial proportion of transmissions may occur from nonresident adults. The benefits of increased ventilation are maximized when the period of infectivity is reduced by prompt treatment of source cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: First Nations communities in Canada experience disproportionately high levels of overcrowded housing, degree of isolation, and rates of tuberculosis (TB). A study was done to assess the association between housing density, isolation, and the occurrence of TB in First Nations communities. METHODS: Average persons per room (ppr), isolation type, average household income, population, and TB cases (1997-1999) at the community level were entered into a database. Tuberculosis notification rates and 95{\%} CI were calculated for different strata of ppr and isolation. Two multiple logistic regression models were developed to examine the association of ppr, isolation, income, and population with the occurrence of {\textgreater}/=1, or {\textgreater}/=2, TB cases in a community. RESULTS: The rate was 18.9 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI: 13.3-24.6) in communities with an average of 0.4-0.6 ppr, while communities with 1.0-1.2 ppr had a rate of 113.0 per 100,000 (95{\%} CI: 95.4-130.5). An increase of 0.1 ppr in a community was associated with a 40{\%} increase in risk of {\textgreater}/=2 TB cases occurring, while an increase of {\$}10,000 in community household income was associated with 0.25 the risk, and being an isolated community increased risk by 2.5 times. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows a significant association between housing density, isolation, income levels, and TB. Overcrowded housing has the potential to increase exposure of susceptible individuals to infectious TB cases, and isolation from health services may increase the likelihood of TB.},

abstract = {The relative contributions of transmission and reactivation of latent infection to TB cases observed clinically has been reported in many situations, but always with some uncertainty. Genotyped data from TB organisms obtained from patients have been used as the basis for heuristic distinctions between circulating (clustered strains) and reactivated infections (unclustered strains). Naive methods previously applied to the analysis of such data are known to provide biased estimates of the proportion of unclustered cases. The hypergeometric distribution, which generates probabilities of observing clusters of a given size as realized clusters of all possible sizes, is analyzed in this paper to yield a formal estimator for genotype cluster sizes. Subtle aspects of numerical stability, bias, and variance are explored. This formal estimator is seen to be stable with respect to the epidemiologically interesting properties of the cluster size distribution (the number of clusters and the number of singletons) though it does not yield satisfactory estimates of the number of clusters of larger sizes. The problem that even complete coverage of genotyping, in a practical sampling frame, will only provide a partial view of the actual transmission network remains to be explored.},

abstract = {The emergence of drug resistance in M. tuberculosis undermines the efficacy of tuberculosis (TB) treatment in individuals and of TB control programs in populations. Multiple drug resistance is often attributed to sequential functional monotherapy, and standard initial treatment regimens have therefore been designed to include simultaneous use of four different antibiotics. Despite the widespread use of combination therapy, highly resistant M. tb strains have emerged in many settings. Here we use a stochastic birth-death model to estimate the probability of the emergence of multidrug resistance during the growth of a population of initially drug sensitive TB bacilli within an infected host. We find that the probability of the emergence of resistance to the two principal anti-TB drugs before initiation of therapy ranges from 10(-5) to 10(-4); while rare, this is several orders of magnitude higher than previous estimates. This finding suggests that multidrug resistant M. tb may not be an entirely "man-made" phenomenon and may help explain how highly drug resistant forms of TB have independently emerged in many settings.},

abstract = {Importance: Testing for and treating latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is among the main strategies to achieve TB elimination in the United States. The best approach to testing among non-US born residents, particularly those with comorbid conditions, is uncertain. Objective: To estimate health outcomes, costs, and cost-effectiveness of LTBI testing and treatment among non-US born residents with and without medical comorbidities. Design, Setting, and Participants: Decision analytic tree and Markov cohort simulation model among non-US born residents with no comorbidities, with diabetes, with HIV infection, or with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) using a health care sector perspective with 3{\%} annual discounting. Strategies compared included no testing, tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA), confirm positive (initial TST, IGRA only for TST-positive results; both tests positive indicates LTBI), and confirm negative (initial IGRA, then TST for IGRA-negative; any test positive indicates LTBI). All strategies were coupled to treatment with 3 months of self-administered rifapentine and isoniazid. Main Outcomes and Measures: Number needed to test and treat to prevent 1 case of TB reactivation, discounted quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), discounted lifetime medical costs, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). Results: Improving health outcomes increased costs, with choice of test dependent on willingness to pay. Strategies ranked by ascending costs and benefits: no testing, confirm positive, TST, IGRA, and confirm negative. The ICERs varied by non-US born patient risk group: patients with no comorbidities, IGRA was likely cost-effective at {\$}83000/QALY; patients with diabetes, both confirm positive ({\$}53000/QALY) and IGRA ({\$}120000/QALY) were likely cost-effective; patients with HIV, confirm negative was clearly preferred ({\$}63000/QALY); and patients with ESRD, no testing was cost-effective. Increased LTBI prevalence and reduced return for TST reading improved IGRA's relative performance. In 10000 probabilistic simulations among non-US born patients with no comorbidities, with diabetes, and with HIV, some form of testing was virtually always cost-effective. These simulations highlight the uncertainty of test choice for non-US born patients with no comorbidities and non-US born patients with diabetes, but strategies including IGRA were preferred in over 60{\%} of simulations for all non-US born populations except those with ESRD. Conclusions and Relevance: Testing for and treating LTBI among non-US born residents with and without selected comorbidities is likely cost-effective except among those with ESRD in whom competing risks of death limit benefits. Strategies including IGRA fell below a {\$}100000/QALY willingness-to-pay threshold for non-US born patients with no comorbidities, patients with diabetes, and patients with HIV.},

We conducted this study to investigate associated factors for recurrent TB in Taiwan, which has a relatively low prevalence of HIV.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: A case-control study nested within a nationwide population-based cohort was performed using the Taiwan National Health Insurance (NHI) database from 1998 to 2010. Patients with notified TB were identified according to diagnosis codes and prescriptions of anti-TB drugs for more than 60 days. Recurrent TB was defined as cases being retreated for more than 60 days and 6 months after the end of previous TB episode. Four controls were randomly selected from cohort and matched to each case by observational period within a calendar year. Socio-demographic variables and comorbidities were evaluated as factors associated with TB recurrence.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: There were totally 760 patients being investigated (608 controls and 152 cases). During an average 5.12 years of follow-up, 3.76{\%} of all developed recurrent TB and the incidence of TB recurrence was 734 per 100,000 person-years. About half of recurrence (55{\%}) was notified within three years of follow-up, and most (86{\%}) recurrences were intrapulmonary. Independent associated factors for TB recurrence included: male (odds ratio, OR: 2.23, 95{\%} confidence interval, CI: 1.40-3.53), diabetes mellitus (DM) (OR: 1.51, 95{\%} CI: 1.02-2.13), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (OR: 1.59, 95{\%} CI: 1.08-2.36) and lower socio-economic status (p=0.001 between groups).$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Despite low prevalence of HIV in the Taiwanese population, the incidence of recurrent TB among Taiwanese was not less than that of other countries.

abstract = {Policies regarding the use of the Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine for tuberculosis vary greatly throughout the international community. In several countries, consideration of discontinuing universal vaccination programs is currently under way. The arguments against mass vaccination are that the effectiveness of BCG in preventing tuberculosis is uncertain and that BCG vaccination can interfere with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis. In this work, we pose a dynamical systems model for the population-level dynamics of tuberculosis in order to study the trade-off which occurs between vaccination and detection/treatment of latent tuberculosis. We assume that latent infection in vaccinated individuals is completely undetectable. For the case of a country with very low levels of tuberculosis, we establish analytic thresholds, via stability analysis and the basic reproductive number, which determine the optimal vaccination policy, given the effectiveness of the vaccine and the detection/treatment rate of latent tuberculosis. The results of this work suggest that it is unlikely that a country detects and treats latent tuberculosis at a high enough rate to justify the discontinuation of mass vaccination from this perspective.},

abstract = {Mathematical models are developed to aid in the investigation of the implications of heterogeneity in contact with infection within a community, on the design of mass vaccination programmes for the control of childhood viral and bacterial infections in developed countries. Analyses are focused on age-dependency in the rate at which individuals acquire infection, the question of 'who acquires infection from whom', and the implications of genetic variability in susceptibility to infection. Throughout, theoretical predictions are based on parameter estimates obtained from epidemiological studies and are compared with observed temporal trends in disease incidence and age-stratified serological profiles. Analysis of case notification records and serological data suggest that the rate at which individuals acquire many common infections changes from medium to high and then to low levels in the infant, child and teenage plus adult age groups respectively. Such apparent age-dependency in attack rate acts to reduce slightly the predicted levels of herd immunity required for the eradication of infections such as measles, when compared with the predictions of models based on age-independent transmission. The action of maternally derived immunity in prohibiting vaccination in infants, and the broad span of age classes over which vaccination currently takes place in the U.K., however, argue that levels of herd immunity of between 90 and 94{\%} would be required to eliminate measles. Problems surrounding the interpretation of apparent age-related trends in the acquisition of infection and their relevance to the design of vaccination programmes, are discussed in relation to the possible role of genetically based variation in susceptibility to infection and observations on epidemics in 'virgin' populations. Heterogeneous mixing models provide predictions of changes in serology and disease incidence under the impact of mass vaccination which well mirror observed trends in England and Wales.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis has been observed to thrive in conditions of poverty and there has been a long history of documented linkage between tuberculosis and poverty at the society and community level. This paper utilizes an agent-based model to incorporate three aspects of the conditions faced by the economically poorer and vulnerable individuals. The three aspects considered in the paper include undernutrition, poor living conditions (overcrowding, inadequate ventilation) and access to adequate health care facilities. The paper aims to understand the effects of poor living conditions on the emergence of latent tuberculosis infection among individuals exposed to the disease. Also, we consider the effect of undernutrition on the immune system response to control the progression from the latent tuberculosis infection to the active tuberculosis disease. Finally, the paper studies the effect on adequate access to proper health care as a factor on the emergence of tuberculosis. The results obtained indicate that malnutrition coupled with limited access to adequate health care increases the risk of emergence of the active tuberculosis disease and also that inadequate ventilation increases the risk of emergence of the latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI).},

abstract = {SETTING: The potential cost-effectiveness of improved diagnostic tests for tuberculosis (TB) in resource-limited settings is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the incremental cost-effectiveness of a hypothetical new point-of-care TB diagnostic test in South Africa, Brazil and Kenya. DESIGN: Decision-analysis model, adding four diagnostic interventions (sputum smear microscopy, new test, smear plus new test and smear plus TB culture) to a baseline of existing infrastructure without smear. RESULTS: Adding sputum smear was estimated to be more cost-effective (incremental cost per disability-adjusted life year [DALY] of {\$}86 [South Africa], {\$}131 [Brazil], {\$}38 (Kenya]) than a new TB diagnostic with 70{\%} sensitivity, 95{\%} specificity and price of {\$}20 per test ({\$}198 [South Africa], {\$}275 [Brazil], {\$}84 [Kenya]). However, compared to sputum smear, smear plus new test averted 46-49{\%} more DALYs per 1000 TB suspects (321 vs. 215 [South Africa], 243 vs. 166 [Brazil], 790 vs. 531 [Kenya]), at an incremental cost of {\$}170 (Kenya) to {\$}625 (Brazil) per DALY averted. Cost-effectiveness was most sensitive to the specificity and price of the new test, the baseline TB case detection rate and the discount rate. CONCLUSION: Novel diagnostic tests for TB are potentially highly cost-effective. Cost-effectiveness is maximized by high-specificity, low-cost tests deployed to regions with poor infrastructure.},

abstract = {Background: Continuing rises in tuberculosis notifications in the UK are attributable to cases in foreign-born immigrants. National guidance for immigrant screening is hampered by a lack of data about the prevalence of, and risk factors for, latent tuberculosis infection in immigrants. We aimed to determine the prevalence of latent infection in immigrants to the UK to define which groups should be screened and to quantify cost-effectiveness. Methods: In our multicentre cohort study and cost-effectiveness analysis we analysed demographic and test results from three centres in the UK (from 2008 to 2010) that used interferon-?? release-assay (IGRA) to screen immigrants aged 35 years or younger for latent tuberculosis infection. We assessed factors associated with latent infection by use of logistic regression and calculated the yields and cost-effectiveness of screening at different levels of tuberculosis incidence in immigrants' countries of origin with a decision analysis model. Findings: Results for IGRA-based screening were positive in 245 of 1229 immigrants (20{\%}), negative in 982 (80{\%}), and indeterminate in two (0??2{\%}). Positive results were independently associated with increases in tuberculosis incidence in immigrants' countries of origin (p=0??0006), male sex (p=0??046), and age (p{\textless}0??0001). National policy thus far would fail to detect 71{\%} of individuals with latent infection. The two most cost-effective strategies were to screen individuals from countries with a tuberculosis incidence of more than 250 cases per 100 000 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio [ICER] was ??17 956 [??1=US{\$}1??60] per prevented case of tuberculosis) and at more than 150 cases per 100 000 (including immigrants from the Indian subcontinent), which identified 92{\%} of infected immigrants and prevented an additional 29 cases at an ICER of ??20 819 per additional case averted. Interpretation: Screening for latent infection can be implemented cost-effectively at a level of incidence that identifies most immigrants with latent tuberculosis, thereby preventing substantial numbers of future cases of active tuberculosis.

A fraction of infectious individuals that begun their treatment will not return to the hospital for the examination of sputum. This fact usually occurs in sub-Saharan Africa, due to many reasons. The model incorporates migrations from one patch to another. The existence and uniqueness of the associated equilibria are discussed. A Lyapunov function is used to show that when the basic reproduction ratio is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally and asymptotically stable. When it is greater than one, there exists at least one endemic equilibrium. The local stability of endemic equilibria can be illustrated using numerical simulations. Numerical simulation results are provided to illustrate the theoretical results and analyze the influence of lost sight individuals.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, predominantly affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources are limited. As such, countries need to be able to choose the most efficient interventions for their respective setting. Mathematical models can be valuable tools to inform rational policy decisions and improve resource allocation, but are often unavailable or inaccessible for LMICs, particularly in TB. We developed TIME Impact, a user-friendly TB model that enables local capacity building and strengthens country-specific policy discussions to inform support funding applications at the (sub-)national level (e.g. Ministry of Finance) or to international donors (e.g. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria).TIME Impact is an epidemiological transmission model nested in TIME, a set of TB modelling tools available for free download within the widely-used Spectrum software. The TIME Impact model reflects key aspects of the natural history of TB, with additional structure for HIV/ART, drug resistance, treatment history and age. TIME Impact enables national TB programmes (NTPs) and other TB policymakers to better understand their own TB epidemic, plan their response, apply for funding and evaluate the implementation of the response.The explicit aim of TIME Impact's user-friendly interface is to enable training of local and international TB experts towards independent use. During application of TIME Impact, close involvement of the NTPs and other local partners also builds critical understanding of the modelling methods, assumptions and limitations inherent to modelling. This is essential to generate broad country-level ownership of the modelling data inputs and results. In turn, it stimulates discussions and a review of the current evidence and assumptions, strengthening the decision-making process in general.TIME Impact has been effectively applied in a variety of settings. In South Africa, it informed the first South African HIV and TB Investment Cases and successfully leveraged additional resources from the National Treasury at a time of austerity. In Ghana, a long-term TIME model-centred interaction with the NTP provided new insights into the local epidemiology and guided resource allocation decisions to improve impact.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND Mathematical modelling of infectious diseases transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route (e.g., pandemic influenza) is increasingly being used to determine the impact of possible interventions. Although mixing patterns are known to be crucial determinants for model outcome, researchers often rely on a priori contact assumptions with little or no empirical basis. We conducted a population-based prospective survey of mixing patterns in eight European countries using a common paper-diary methodology. METHODS AND FINDINGS 7,290 participants recorded characteristics of 97,904 contacts with different individuals during one day, including age, sex, location, duration, frequency, and occurrence of physical contact. We found that mixing patterns and contact characteristics were remarkably similar across different European countries. Contact patterns were highly assortative with age: schoolchildren and young adults in particular tended to mix with people of the same age. Contacts lasting at least one hour or occurring on a daily basis mostly involved physical contact, while short duration and infrequent contacts tended to be nonphysical. Contacts at home, school, or leisure were more likely to be physical than contacts at the workplace or while travelling. Preliminary modelling indicates that 5- to 19-year-olds are expected to suffer the highest incidence during the initial epidemic phase of an emerging infection transmitted through social contacts measured here when the population is completely susceptible. CONCLUSIONS To our knowledge, our study provides the first large-scale quantitative approach to contact patterns relevant for infections transmitted by the respiratory or close-contact route, and the results should lead to improved parameterisation of mathematical models used to design control strategies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Confirmation of a diagnosis of tuberculosis in children (aged {\textless}15 years) is challenging; under-reporting can result even when children do present to health services. Direct incidence estimates are unavailable, and WHO estimates build on paediatric notifications, with adjustment for incomplete surveillance by the same factor as adult notifications. We aimed to estimate the incidence of infection and disease in children, the prevalence of infection, and household exposure in the 22 countries with a high burden of the disease. METHODS: Within a mechanistic mathematical model, we combined estimates of adult tuberculosis prevalence in 2010, with aspects of the natural history of paediatric tuberculosis. In a household model, we estimated household exposure and infection. We accounted for the effects of age, BCG vaccination, and HIV infection. Additionally, we tested sensitivity to key structural assumptions by repeating all analyses without variation in BCG efficacy by latitude. FINDINGS: The median number of children estimated to be sharing a household with an individual with infectious tuberculosis in 2010 was 15,319,701 (IQR 13,766,297-17,061,821). In 2010, the median number of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infections in children was 7,591,759 (5,800,053-9,969,780), and 650,977 children (424,871-983,118) developed disease. Cumulative exposure meant that the median number of children with latent infection in 2010 was 53,234,854 (41,111,669-68,959,804). The model suggests that 35{\%} (23-54) of paediatric cases of tuberculosis in the 15 countries reporting notifications by age in 2010 were detected. India is predicted to account for 27{\%} (22-33) of the total burden of paediatric tuberculosis in the 22 countries. The predicted proportion of tuberculosis burden in children for each country correlated with incidence, varying between 4{\%} and 21{\%}. INTERPRETATION: Our model has shown that the incidence of paediatric tuberculosis is higher than the number of notifications, particularly in young children. Estimates of current household exposure and cumulative infection suggest an enormous opportunity for preventive treatment. FUNDING: UNITAID and the US Agency for International Development.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Detailed analysis of the dynamic interactions among biological, environmental, social, and economic factors that favour the spread of certain diseases is extremely useful for designing effective control strategies. Diseases like tuberculosis that kills somebody every 15 seconds in the world, require methods that take into account the disease dynamics to design truly efficient control and surveillance strategies. The usual and well established statistical approaches provide insights into the cause-effect relationships that favour disease transmission but they only estimate risk areas, spatial or temporal trends. Here we introduce a novel approach that allows figuring out the dynamical behaviour of the disease spreading. This information can subsequently be used to validate mathematical models of the dissemination process from which the underlying mechanisms that are responsible for this spreading could be inferred. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The method presented here is based on the analysis of the spread of tuberculosis in a Brazilian endemic city during five consecutive years. The detailed analysis of the spatio-temporal correlation of the yearly geo-referenced data, using different characteristic times of the disease evolution, allowed us to trace the temporal path of the aetiological agent, to locate the sources of infection, and to characterize the dynamics of disease spreading. Consequently, the method also allowed for the identification of socio-economic factors that influence the process. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The information obtained can contribute to more effective budget allocation, drug distribution and recruitment of human skilled resources, as well as guiding the design of vaccination programs. We propose that this novel strategy can also be applied to the evaluation of other diseases as well as other social processes.},

abstract = {The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0{\%} (range 0.9-64.3{\%}), close to the 6.3{\%} (range 0-28.1{\%}) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9{\%} (0.1-5.9{\%}) and 1.0{\%} (range 0-14.1{\%}), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To substantiate this result, further measurements are needed of the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains.},

@article{Eralp2012,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Methods for determining cost-effectiveness of different treatments are well established, unlike appraisal of non-drug interventions, including novel diagnostics and biomarkers. OBJECTIVE: The authors develop and validate a new health economic model by comparing cost-effectiveness of tuberculin skin test (TST); blood test, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) and TST followed by IGRA in conditional sequence, in screening healthcare workers for latent or active tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: The authors focus on healthy life years gained as the benefit metric, rather than quality-adjusted life years given limited data to estimate quality adjustments of life years with TB and complications of treatment, like hepatitis. Healthy life years gained refer to the number of TB or hepatitis cases avoided and the increase in life expectancy. The authors incorporate disease and test parameters informed by systematic meta-analyses and clinical practice. Health and economic outcomes of each strategy are modelled as a decision tree in Markov chains, representing different health states informed by epidemiology. Cost and effectiveness values are generated as the individual is cycled through 20 years of the model. Key parameters undergo one-way and Monte Carlo probabilistic sensitivity analyses. SETTING: Screening healthcare workers in secondary and tertiary care. RESULTS: IGRA is the most effective strategy, with incremental costs per healthy life year gained of pound10 614- pound20 929, base case, pound8021- pound18 348, market costs TST pound45, IGRA pound90, IGRA specificities of 99{\%}-97{\%}; mean (5{\%}, 95{\%}), pound12 060 ( pound4137- pound38 418) by Monte Carlo analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Incremental costs per healthy life year gained, a conservative estimate of benefit, are comparable to the pound20 000- pound30 000 NICE band for IGRA alone, across wide differences in disease and test parameters. Health gains justify IGRA costs, even if IGRA tests cost three times TST. This health economic model offers a powerful tool for appraising non-drug interventions in the market and under development.},

abstract = {SETTING: England and Wales, 2001-2003. OBJECTIVES: To describe demographic and clinical characteristics of tuberculosis (TB) in non-UK-born persons and compare with UK-born cases to inform public health action and health service provision. DESIGN: Analysis of surveillance data. RESULTS: Among the 67{\%} of cases who were non-UK-born, TB incidence was 88/100000 compared to 4/100000 among the UK-born. UK-born minority ethnic groups were also at increased risk of TB. Although the highest TB incidence occurred in recent entrants to the UK, nearly half the cases had been resident for {\textgreater}or=5 years. The majority of non-UK-born cases originated from South Asia (48{\%}) and sub-Saharan Africa (35{\%}). The demographic characteristics of non-UK-born and UK-born cases differed. In addition, non-UK-born cases were less likely to have pulmonary TB than the UK-born (52{\%} vs. 73{\%}, chi(2) P{\textless}0.001), but were more likely to have isoniazid-resistant disease (8{\%} vs. 6{\%}, chi(2) P=0.002), depending on region of birth. CONCLUSIONS: During 2001-2003, most TB cases were non-UK-born. TB services need to take the characteristics of TB in this group into account. Furthermore, awareness of the risk of disease is required among the non-UK-born for many years after arrival into the UK, and among UK-born minority ethnic groups.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the earliest recorded human diseases and still one of the deadliest worldwide. Its causative agent is the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cytokine-mediated macrophage activation is a necessary step in control of bacterial growth, and early immunologic events in lymph node and lung are crucial to the outcome of infection, although the factors that influence these environments and the immune response are poorly understood. Our goal is to build the next-generation two-compartmental model of the immune response to provide a gateway to more spatial and mechanistic investigations of M. tuberculosis infection in the LN and lung. Crucial immune factors emerge that affect macrophage populations and inflammation, namely TNF-dependent recruitment and apoptosis, and IL-10 levels. Surprisingly, bacterial load plays a less important role than TNF in increasing the population of infected macrophages and inflammation. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish the effects of pro-inflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines on the spectrum of phagocyte populations (macrophages and dendritic cells) in the lung and lymph node. Our results suggest that TNF is a major mediator of recruitment of phagocytes to the lungs. In contrast, IL-10 plays a role in balancing the dominant macrophage phenotype in LN and lung.},

Detractors of BCG point to its uncertain effectiveness and its interference with the detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). In order to quantify the trade-off between vaccination and treatment of LTBI, a mathematical model was designed and calibrated to data from Brazil, Ghana, Germany, India, Mexico, Romania, the United Kingdom and the United States. Country-specific thresholds for when LTBI treatment outperforms mass vaccination were found and the consequences of policy changes were estimated. Our results suggest that vaccination outperforms LTBI treatment in all settings but with greatly reduced efficiency in low incidence countries. While national policy statements emphasize BCG's interference with LTBI detection, we find that reinfection should be more determinant of a country's proper policy choice.},

abstract = {In recent years, bacteria have become resistant to antibiotics, leading to a decline in the effectiveness of antibiotics in treating infectious diseases. A mathematical model for multi-strain tuberculosis transmission dynamics to assess the burden of drug-sensitive, multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis is formulated and analyzed. Each single strain submodel is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation when the threshold parameter is less than unity. Both analytical and numerical results show that resistance to drugs increase with increase in drug use, that is, active tuberculosis treatment results in a reduction of drug sensitive and increase in multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. Furthermore, use of second line drugs results in a decrease of the multidrug-resistant and increase of extensively drug resistant tuberculosis as most cases of multidrug resistant tuberculosis occur as a result of inappropriate, misuse or mismanaged treatment. Both the analytic results and numerical simulations suggest that quarantine of extensively drug resistant TB cases in addition to treatment of other forms of TB may be able to reduce the spread of the epidemic in poor resource-settings.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: In many communities where TB occurs at high incidence, the major force driving the epidemic is transmission. It is plausible that the typical long delay from the onset of infectious disease to diagnosis and commencement of treatment is almost certainly the major factor contributing to the high rate of transmission. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study is confined to communities which are epidemiologically relatively isolated and which have low HIV incidence. The consequences of delays to diagnosis are analyzed and the existence of a threshold delay value is demonstrated. It is shown that unless a sufficient number of cases are detected before this threshold, the epidemic will escalate. The method used for the analysis avoids the standard computer integration of systems of differential equations since the intention is to present a line of reasoning that reveals the essential dynamics of an epidemic in an intuitively clear way that is nevertheless quantitatively realistic. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis presented here shows that typical delays to diagnosis present a major obstacle to the control of a TB epidemic. Control can be achieved by optimizing the rapid identification of TB cases together with measures to increase the threshold value. A calculated and aggressive program is therefore necessary in order to bring about a reduction in the prevalence of TB in a community by decreasing the time to diagnosis in all its ramifications. Intervention strategies to increase the threshold value relative to the time to diagnosis and which thereby decrease disease incidence are discussed.},

First, the LFS is unusual in that it asks work-related health questions to those who are not currently employed. This facilitates a more representative analysis than that which is constrained to focus only on those currently in work. Second, information in the LFS facilitates a comparison of work-related health problems that stem from current employment to a more encompassing measure that includes those related to a former job. We find that accounting for each of these sources of bias increases the age work-related health risk gradient, and suggest that ignoring such effects will underestimate the work-related health implications of current policies to extend working lives. {\textcopyright} 2016 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd and London School of Economics.},

Which interventions to prevent the spread of drug-resistant TB are effective and feasible? Models offer insight into the acquisition and amplification of drug resistance, reveal the importance of distinguishing the intrinsic and extrinsic determinants of the reproductive capacity of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis, and demonstrate the cost effectiveness of interventions for drug-resistant TB.

abstract = {Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) is an extraordinarily successful human pathogen, one of the major causes of death by infectious disease worldwide. A key issue for the study of tuberculosis is to understand why individuals infected with Mtb experience different clinical outcomes. To better understand the dynamics of Mtb infection and immunity, we coupled nonhuman primate experiments with a mathematical model we previously developed that qualitatively and quantitatively captures important processes of cellular priming and activation. These processes occur between the lung and the nearest draining lymph node where the key cells mediating this process are the dendritic cells (DC). The nonhuman primate experiments consist of bacteria and cell numbers from tissues of 17 adult cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) that were infected with Mtb strain Erdman (similar to25 CFU/animal via bronchoscope). The main result of this work is that delays in either DC migration to the draining lymph node or T cell trafficking to the site of infection can alter the outcome of Mtb infection, defining progression to primary disease or latent infection and reactivated tuberculosis. Our results also support the idea that the development of a new generation of treatment against Mtb should optimally elicit a fast DC turnover at the site of infection, as well as strong activation of DCs for maximal Ag presentation and production of key cytokines. This will induce the most protective T cell response.},

abstract = {Disease modeling is increasingly being used to evaluate the effect of health intervention strategies, particularly for infectious diseases. However, the utility and application of such models are hampered by the inconsistent use of infectious disease modeling terms between and within disciplines. We sought to standardize the lexicon of infectious disease modeling terms and develop a glossary of terms commonly used in describing models' assumptions, parameters, variables, and outcomes. We combined a comprehensive literature review of relevant terms with an online forum discussion in a virtual community of practice, mod4PH (Modeling for Public Health). Using a convergent discussion process and consensus amongst the members of mod4PH, a glossary of terms was developed as an online resource. We anticipate that the glossary will improve inter- and intradisciplinary communication and will result in a greater uptake and understanding of disease modeling outcomes in heath policy decision-making. We highlight the role of the mod4PH community of practice and the methodologies used in this endeavor to link theory, policy, and practice in the public health domain.},

The method avoids the requirement of satisfying the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition, which is necessary in implementing the explicit version of the finite-difference method, but imposes an impractical bound on the time step. Instead, diffusion is modeled by a matrix-based, steady state approximate solution to the diffusion equation.

abstract = {SETTING: Isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) is effective for preventing active tuberculosis (TB), although its mechanism of action is poorly understood and the optimal disease burden for IPT use has not been defined. OBJECTIVE: To describe the relationship between TB incidence and IPT effectiveness. METHODS: We constructed a model of TB transmission dynamics to investigate IPT effectiveness under various epidemiological settings. The model structure was intended to be highly adaptable to uncertainty in both input parameters and the mechanism of action of IPT. To determine the optimal setting for IPT use, we identified the lowest number needed to treat (NNT) with IPT to prevent one case of active TB. RESULTS: We found that the NNT as a function of TB incidence shows a 'U-shape', whereby IPT impact is greatest at an intermediate incidence and attenuated at both lower and higher incidence levels. This U-shape was observed over a broad range of parameter values; the optimal TB incidence was between 500 and 900 cases per 100 000 per year. CONCLUSIONS: TB burden is a critical factor to consider when making decisions about communitywide implementation of IPT. We believe that the total disease burden should not preclude programmatic application of IPT.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of adding school based Mantoux screening programs to the New South Wales current TB prevention strategy. METHOD: A decision analysis model compared the costs and consequences of screening strategies against the current no-screen strategy. Costs associated with screening and with treating future cases of TB were considered. Consequences considered were deaths and adult cases of TB prevented. The study was based on data from prevalence surveys conducted in 1992 and 1994 in Central and South Western Sydney, New South Wales. Screening strategies considered were screening all or only overseas born (OSB) 6 year olds and all or only OSB 14 year olds in school settings. RESULTS: Screening 14 year olds prevented more deaths and adult cases of TB than screening 6 year olds for a similar cost. For both age groups targeted screening of OSB children was more cost-effective than screening all children. Targeted screening of 14 year olds--the most cost effective option--cost {\$}17,956 (costs and benefits discounted at 5{\%}) per adult case prevented, equivalent to approximately {\$}130,000 per life year saved. The cost-effectiveness ratios decline substantially if lower discount rates and less conservative assumptions are applied. CONCLUSION: Targeted screening was more cost effective than screening all children, however, there are ethical implications of targeting a group based on their origin of birth. IMPLICATIONS: As prevention and control of TB continues to be a high priority for NSW, the implications of a school based screening program should be seriously considered.},

The observed data from the Korea Center for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) shows a certain rise of active-TB incidence individuals after 2001 yr. Because of this sudden jump, we have considered two different periods for best fitting the model: prior to 2001 yr and posterior to 2001 yr. The least-squares fitting has been used for estimating model parameters to the observed data of active-TB incidence. Our model agrees well with the observed data. In this work, we also propose optimal treatment strategies of TB model in South Korea for the future. We have considered three control mechanisms representing distancing, case finding and case holding efforts. Optimal control programs have been proposed in various scenarios, in order to minimize the number of exposed and infectious individuals and the cost of implementing the control treatment.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prevalence of tuberculosis (TB) in the elderly is higher than that in the general population, and elderly populations are considered a high-risk group. Currently, annual TB screening of Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG)-vaccinated people aged over 65 years is performed by an annual chest x-ray examination (CXR) in Japan. Interferon-gamma release assays (QuantiFERON-TB Gold and QuantiFERON-TB Gold In-Tube [QFT]) are new alternatives to the tuberculin skin test to diagnose latent TB infection (LTBI) that have no cross-reactivity with the BCG vaccine. We evaluated the cost effectiveness of QFT versus CXR versus no screening in BCG-vaccinated elderly populations. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of QFT, CXR, and no screening. The target population was a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 65-year-olds, using a societal perspective and a lifetime horizon. All costs and clinical benefits were discounted at a fixed annual rate of 3{\%}. RESULTS: In the base-case analysis, a no-screening strategy resulted in the lowest cost ({\$}US303.51; 14.6475 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]) compared with CXR ({\$}US393.22; 14.6477 QALYs) and QFT ({\$}US525.45; 14.6516 QALYs) [year 2008 values]. The sensitivity of QFT, as well as the prevalence of TB and LTBI, influenced the cost effectiveness; when the sensitivity of QFT was higher than 0.89, QFT became more cost effective than providing no screening. As the prevalence of LTBI and TB increased, the QFT strategy became progressively more cost effective. CONCLUSIONS: Providing no routine TB screening is currently the most cost-effective strategy for BCG-vaccinated elderly populations in Japan. There appears to be little role for CXR in TB screening of elderly populations. These findings may be applicable to other countries with intermediate and high TB risks when choosing optimal TB screening of elderly populations.},

abstract = {The paper explores the incidence of over and under education and the effect on earnings for immigrants and natives who hold UK qualifications, drawn from the Quarterly Labour Force Survey 1993-2003. The paper also compares earnings penalties associated with over and under education across immigrant and minority ethnic groups for men and women. The results show that compared to Whites, Black African, Other Non-White and Indian men are more likely to be over-educated, whilst for women it is Indian and Pakistani/Bangladeshi's who are more likely to be over-educated. Estimating earnings equations shows significantly large over-education penalties for South Asian immigrant and native men, as well as White immigrant men, Black women and White UK born women. However, there are large returns to occupational skills for some minority ethnic and immigrant groups, over and above the returns to qualifications. It is suggested that these groups may therefore find it easier to find a suitable job for their UK education level if higher or further education programmes for immigrants were combined with occupational specific training. ?? 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The Mycobacterium tuberculosis bacilli's potency to cause persistent latent infection that is unresponsive to the current cocktail of TB drugs is strongly associated with its ability to adapt to changing intracellular environments, and tolerating, evading and subverting host defence mechanisms. We applied a combination of bioinformatics and mathematical modelling methods to enhance the understanding of TB latency dynamics. Analysis of time course microarray gene expression data was carried out and gene profiles for bacilli adaptation and survival in latency, simulated by hypoxia were determined. Reverse network engineering techniques were used to predict gene dependencies and regulatory interactions. Biochemical systems theory was applied to mathematically model the inferred gene regulatory networks. Significant regulatory genes involved in latency were determined by a combination of systems biology procedures and mathematical modelling of the inferred regulatory networks. Analysis of gene clusters of the inferred networks in the stationary and non-replicating phases of the bacilli predicted probable functions of some of the latency genes to be associated with latency genes of known functions. The systems biology approach and mathematical computational deletion experiments predicted key genes in the TB latency/dormancy program that may be possible TB drug targets. However, these gene candidates require experimental testing and validation.},

abstract = {Over 50{\%} of the global burden of tuberculosis occurs in South East Asia and the Western Pacific. Since 1950, notification rates in high-income countries in these settings have declined slowly and have remained over ten-fold greater than those in Western populations. The reasons for the slow decline are poorly understood. Using an age-structured model describing the incidence of Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease applied to notification data from Hong Kong, we illustrate that in Hong Kong, a high prevalence of M. tuberculosis infection among older individuals and a high risk of disease through reactivation (e.g. up to 17-fold greater than that estimated for infected males in the United Kingdom) may explain this slow decline. If this feature of the epidemiology of tuberculosis is widespread, the WHO directly observed treatment short-course (DOTS) strategy may have a smaller impact in Asia in the short term than has been implied by recent predictions, all of which have been based on disease risk estimates derived from Western Europe. As a result, it may be difficult to meet the targets for tuberculosis control, which have been prescribed by the UN Millennium Development Goals.},

The extended model now classifies the latently infected individuals by their level of tuberculosis awareness (as was done for the susceptible sub-population) and further expands the number of key factors that can positively affect the tuberculosis case detection rate. The effect of these identified factors on the associated reproduction number of the model is considered. It is shown that the system can undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation when the associated reproduction number of the model is less than unity; in a special case, the effect of exogenous re-infection on the backward bifurcation phenomenon is significantly dictated by the level of awareness of the latently infected individuals. Qualitative and quantitative analysis of the model showed the effect of key identified factors on the dynamics of tuberculosis while suggesting a serious concentration on tuberculosis awareness programmes, active case finding strategies and use of active cough identification for identifying likely TB cases and sustaining awareness campaigns over a long period of time.},

abstract = {Understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is important for both biological research and public health applications. It has been widely demonstrated that statistical modeling provides a firm basis for inferring relevant epidemiological quantities from incidence and molecular data. However, the complexity of transmission dynamic models presents two challenges: (1) the likelihood function of the models is generally not computable, and computationally intensive simulation-based inference methods need to be employed, and (2) the model may not be fully identifiable from the available data. While the first difficulty can be tackled by computational and algorithmic advances, the second obstacle is more fundamental. Identifiability issues may lead to inferences that are driven more by prior assumptions than by the data themselves. We consider a popular and relatively simple yet analytically intractable model for the spread of tuberculosis based on classical IS6110 fingerprinting data. We report on the identifiability of the model, also presenting some methodological advances regarding the inference. Using likelihood approximations, we show that the reproductive value cannot be identified from the data available and that the posterior distributions obtained in previous work have likely been substantially dominated by the assumed prior distribution. Further, we show that the inferences are influenced by the assumed infectious population size, which generally has been kept fixed in previous work. We demonstrate that the infectious population size can be inferred if the remaining epidemiological parameters are already known with sufficient precision.},

@article{Abdou2016,
abstract = {The control of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in cattle herds in the Republic of Ireland (ROI) is partially hindered by spill-back infection from wild badgers (Meles meles). The aim of this study was to determine the relative effects of interventions (combinations of culling and/or vaccination) on bTB dynamics in an Irish badger population. A spatial agent-based stochastic simulation model was developed to evaluate the effect of various control strategies for bovine tuberculosis in badgers: single control strategies (culling, selective culling, vaccination, and vaccine baits), and combined strategies (Test vaccinate/cull (TVC)), split area approaches using culling and vaccination, or selective culling and vaccination, and mixed scenarios where culling was conducted for five years and followed by vaccination or by a TVC strategy. The effect of each control strategy was evaluated over a 20-year period. Badger control was simulated in 25{\%}, 50{\%}, and 75{\%} area (limited area strategy) or in the entire area (100{\%}, wide area strategy). For endemic bTB, a culling strategy was successful in eradicating bTB from the population only if applied as an area-wide strategy. However, this was achieved only by risking the extinction of the badger population. Selective culling strategies (selective culling or TVC) mitigated this negative impact on the badger population's viability. Furthermore, both strategies (selective culling and TVC) allowed the badger population to recover gradually, in compensation for the population reduction following the initial use of removal strategies. The model predicted that vaccination can be effective in reducing bTB prevalence in badgers, when used in combination with culling strategies (i.e. TVC or other strategies). If fecundity was reduced below its natural levels (e.g. by using wildlife contraceptives), the effectiveness of vaccination strategies improved. Split-area simulations highlighted that interventions can have indirect effects (e.g. on population size) in non-treatment areas. Our model suggests that mixed control strategies could maintain infection prevalence to a low level for a considerable period even with a growing population. The model supported the hypothesis that culling strategies appeared to be the most effective method for the control of bTB in badgers using parameters, where available, from ROI, either singly or in combination with other strategies. In this model, the success of a vaccination strategy depended partially upon population density and the proportion of the population infected, therefore an initial culling program (to reduce density and/or remove infected badgers) followed by long-term vaccination may be effective in controlling bTB in badgers.},

abstract = {Despite the availability of effective treatment, tuberculosis (TB) remains a major global cause of mortality. Multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a form of TB that is resistant to at least two drugs used for the treatment of TB, and originally is developed when a case of drug-susceptible TB is improperly or incompletely treated. This work is concerned with a mathematical model to evaluate the effect of MDR-TB on TB epidemic and its control. The model assessing the transmission dynamics of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant TB includes slow TB (cases that result from endogenous reactivation of susceptible and resistant latent infections). We identify the steady states of the model to analyse their stability. We establish threshold conditions for possible scenarios: elimination of sensitive and resistant strains and coexistence of both. We find that the effective reproductive number is composed of two critical values, relative reproductive number for drug-sensitive and drug-resistant strains. Our results imply that the potential for the spreading of the drug-resistant strain should be evaluated within the context of several others factors. We have also found that even the considerably less fit drug-resistant strains can lead to a high MDR-TB incidence, because the treatment is less effective against them.},

Understanding the dynamics of the immune response is crucial to elaborating differences between individuals who contain infection vs those who suffer active disease. Key cells in an adaptive immune response to intracellular pathogens include CD8(+) T cells. Once stimulated, these cells provide a number of different effector functions, each aimed at clearing or containing the pathogen. To explore the role of CD8(+) T cells in an integrative way, we synthesize both published and unpublished data to build and test a mathematical model of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the lung. The model is then used to perform a series of simulations mimicking experimental situations. Selective deletion of CD8(+) T cell subsets suggests a differential contribution for CD8(+) T cell effectors that are cytotoxic as compared with those that produce IFN-gamma. We also determined the minimum levels of effector memory cells of each T cell subset (CD4(+) and CD8(+)) in providing effective protection following vaccination.},

This has been a considerable barrier to understanding latent tuberculosis, and efforts to develop new therapies generally assume that the bacteria are very slowly replicating or nonreplicating during latency. To monitor Mycobacterium tuberculosis replication within hosts, we exploit an unstable plasmid that is lost at a steady, quantifiable rate from dividing cells in the absence of antibiotic selection. By applying a mathematical model, we calculate bacterial growth and death rates during infection of mice. We show that during chronic infection, the cumulative bacterial burden-enumerating total live, dead and removed organisms encountered by the mouse lung-is substantially higher than estimates from colony-forming units. Our data show that M. tuberculosis replicates throughout the course of chronic infection of mice and is restrained by the host immune system. This approach may also shed light on the replication dynamics of other chronic pathogens.},

We present a new mathematical model (the amplifier model) that tracks the emergence and evolution of multiple (pre-MDR, MDR and post-MDR) strains of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. We reconstruct possible evolutionary trajectories that generated hot zones over the past three decades, and identify the key causal factors. Results are consistent with recently reported World Health Organization (WHO) data. Our analyses yield three important insights. First, paradoxically we found that areas with programs that successfully reduced wild-type pansensitive strains often evolved into hot zones. Second, some hot zones emerged even when MDR strains were substantially less fit (and thus less transmissible) than wild-type pansensitive strains. Third, levels of MDR are driven by case-finding rates, cure rates and amplification probabilities. To effectively control MDRTB in the hot zones, it is essential that the WHO specify a goal for minimizing the amplification probability.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a deadly infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). No available vaccine is reliable and, although treatment exists, approximately 2 million people still die each year. The hallmark of TB infection is the granuloma, a self-organizing structure of immune cells forming in the lung and lymph nodes in response to bacterial invasion. Protective immune mechanisms play a role in granuloma formation and maintenance; these act over different time/length scales (e. g., molecular, cellular, and tissue scales). The significance of specific immune factors in determining disease outcome is still poorly understood, despite incredible efforts to establish several animal systems to track infection progression and granuloma formation. Mathematical and computational modeling approaches have recently been applied to address open questions regarding host-pathogen interaction dynamics, including the immune response to Mtb infection and TB granuloma formation. This provides a unique opportunity to identify factors that are crucial to a successful outcome of infection in humans. These modeling tools not only offer an additional avenue for exploring immune dynamics at multiple biological scales but also complement and extend knowledge gained via experimental tools. We review recent modeling efforts in capturing the immune response to Mtb, emphasizing the importance of a multiorgan and multiscale approach that has tuneable resolution. Together with experimentation, systems biology has begun to unravel key factors driving granuloma formation and protective immune response in TB. (C) 2010 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Inc.

abstract = {The discovery of high prevalences of antibiotic resistance in some pathogens, in some parts of the world, has provoked fears of a widespread loss of drug efficacy. Here, we use a mathematical model to investigate the evolution of resistance to four major anti-tuberculosis drugs (isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol and streptomycin) in 47 sites around the world. The model provides a new method of estimating the relative risk of treatment failure for patients carrying drug-resistant strains and the proportion of patients who develop resistance after failing treatment. Using estimates of these two quantities together with other published data, we reconstructed the epidemic spread of isoniazid resistance over the past 50 years. The predicted median prevalence of resistance among new cases today was 7.0{\%} (range 0.9-64.3{\%}), close to the 6.3{\%} (range 0-28.1{\%}) observed. Predicted and observed prevalences of resistance to isoniazid plus rifampicin (multidrug-resistant or MDR-TB) after 30 years of combined drug use were also similar, 0.9{\%} (0.1-5.9{\%}) and 1.0{\%} (range 0-14.1{\%}), respectively. With current data, and under prevailing treatment practices, it appears that MDR-TB will remain a localized problem, rather than becoming a global obstacle to tuberculosis control. To substantiate this result, further measurements are needed of the relative fitness of drug-resistant strains.},

abstract = {The choice of summary statistics is a crucial step in approximate Bayesian computation (ABC). Since statistics are often not sufficient, this choice involves a trade-off between loss of information and reduction of dimensionality. The latter may increase the efficiency of ABC. Here, we propose an approach for choosing summary statistics based on boosting, a technique from the machine-learning literature. We consider different types of boosting and compare them to partial least-squares regression as an alternative. To mitigate the lack of sufficiency, we also propose an approach for choosing summary statistics locally, in the putative neighborhood of the true parameter value. We study a demographic model motivated by the reintroduction of Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) into the Swiss Alps. The parameters of interest are the mean and standard deviation across microsatellites of the scaled ancestral mutation rate ($\theta$(anc) = 4N(e)u) and the proportion of males obtaining access to matings per breeding season ($\omega$). By simulation, we assess the properties of the posterior distribution obtained with the various methods. According to our criteria, ABC with summary statistics chosen locally via boosting with the L(2)-loss performs best. Applying that method to the ibex data, we estimate $\theta$(anc)≈ 1.288 and find that most of the variation across loci of the ancestral mutation rate u is between 7.7 × 10(-4) and 3.5 × 10(-3) per locus per generation. The proportion of males with access to matings is estimated as $\omega$≈ 0.21, which is in good agreement with recent independent estimates.},

Here, with an unprecedented national collection of isolates collected contemporaneously from humans and animals and including a sample of internationally derived isolates, we have used whole-genome sequencing to dissect the phylogenetic associations of the bacterium and its antimicrobial resistance genes through the course of an epidemic. Contrary to current tenets supporting a single homogeneous epidemic, we demonstrate that the bacterium and its resistance genes were largely maintained within animal and human populations separately and that there was limited transmission, in either direction. We also show considerable variation in the resistance profiles, in contrast to the largely stable bacterial core genome, which emphasizes the critical importance of integrated genotypic data sets in understanding the ecology of bacterial zoonoses and antimicrobial resistance.},

abstract = {We propose a stepwise mutation model to describe the dynamics of DNA fingerprint variation in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The genome of M. tuberculosis carries insertion sequences (IS6110) that are relatively stable over time periods of months but have an observable transposition rate over longer time scales. Variability in copy number and genomic location of (IS6110) can be harnessed to generate a DNA fingerprint for each strain, by digesting the genome with a restriction enzyme and using a portion of the element as a probe for Southern blots. The number of bands found for a given genome approximates the number of copies of IS6110 it carries. A large data set of such fingerprints from tuberculosis (TB) cases in San Francisco provides an observed distribution of IS6110 copy number. Implementation of the model through deterministic and stochastic simulation indicates some general features of IS/TB dynamics. By comparing observations with outcomes of the model, we conclude that the IS/TB system is very heterogeneous and far from equilibrium. We find that the transposition parameters have a much stronger effect than the epidemic parameters on copy number distribution.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND We examined the potential sex-differential and non-specific effects of bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG), diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) and measles vaccine (MV) in a rural area of Senegal. METHODS The 4133 children born in the area between 1996 and 1999 were included in the study. Vaccinations were provided at three health centres. Vaccine information was collected through 3-monthly home visits. The survival analysis compared the effects of BCG and DTP according to the following sequence of vaccinations: BCG-first, BCG+DTP1-first, or DTP1-first. We compared DTP and MV between 9 and 24 months of age, as 9 months is the minimum age for MV. RESULTS At 12 months the vaccination coverage was 44{\%}, 46{\%} and 9{\%}, respectively, for BCG, DTP1 and MV. Most children received BCG+DTP1-first and this combination was associated with a significantly lower mortality rate ratio (MRR) of 0.69 (0.53-0.89) compared with unvaccinated children. There was no benefit for children receiving BCG-first or DTP1-first. The female-male MRR was 0.79 (0.64-0.96) among unvaccinated children, but was significantly inversed with 1.45 (1.00-2.10) for children receiving DTP vaccination (test of homogeneity, p=0.006). Children who had received DTP simultaneously with MV or DTP after MV had significantly higher mortality (MRR=2.59 [1.32-5.07]) compared with children having MV-only as their most recent vaccination. After 9 months, the female-male MRR was 0.61 (0.31-1.19) for measles-vaccinated children but remained 1.54 (1.03-2.31) for DTP-vaccinated children who had not received MV (p=0.01). CONCLUSIONS The sequence of routine vaccinations is important for the overall impact on child survival and these vaccines are associated with sex-differential effects.},

The enhanced function of circulating monocytes persisted for at least 3 mo after vaccination and was accompanied by increased expression of activation markers such as CD11b and Toll-like receptor 4. These training effects were induced through the NOD2 receptor and mediated by increased histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation. In experimental studies, BCG vaccination induced T- and B-lymphocyte-independent protection of severe combined immunodeficiency SCID mice from disseminated candidiasis (100{\%} survival in BCG-vaccinated mice vs. 30{\%} in control mice). In conclusion, BCG induces trained immunity and nonspecific protection from infections through epigenetic reprogramming of innate immune cells.},

abstract = {RATIONALE: Isoniazid preventive therapy is effective in reducing the risk of tuberculosis (TB) in persons living with HIV (PLWH); however, screening must exclude TB disease before initiating therapy. Symptom screening alone may be insufficient to exclude TB disease in PLWH because some PLWH with TB disease have no symptoms. The addition of chest radiography (CXR) may improve disease detection. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present analysis was to compare the costs and effects of the addition of CXR to the symptom screening process against the costs and effects of symptom screening alone. METHODS: Using data from Botswana, a decision analytic model was used to compare a "Symptom only" policy against a "Symptom+CXR" policy. The outcomes of interest were cost, death, and isoniazid- and multidrug-resistant TB in a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 PLWH. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: The Symptom+CXR policy prevented 16 isoniazid- and 0.3 multidrug-resistant TB cases; however, because of attrition from the screening process, there were 98 excess cases of TB, 15 excess deaths, and an additional cost of U.S. {\$}127,100. The Symptom+CXR policy reduced deaths only if attrition was close to zero; however, to eliminate attrition the cost would be U.S. {\$}2.8 million per death averted. These findings did not change in best- and worst-case scenario analyses. CONCLUSIONS: In Botswana, a policy with symptom screening only preceding isoniazid-preventive therapy initiation prevents more TB and TB-related deaths, and uses fewer resources, than a policy that uses both CXR and symptom screening.},

abstract = {Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) has gained popularity over the past few years for the analysis of complex models arising in population genetics, epidemiology and system biology. Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) approaches have become work-horses in ABC. Here we discuss how to construct the perturbation kernels that are required in ABC SMC approaches, in order to construct a sequence of distributions that start out from a suitably defined prior and converge towards the unknown posterior. We derive optimality criteria for different kernels, which are based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence between a distribution and the distribution of the perturbed particles. We will show that for many complicated posterior distributions, locally adapted kernels tend to show the best performance. We find that the added moderate cost of adapting kernel functions is easily regained in terms of the higher acceptance rate. We demonstrate the computational efficiency gains in a range of toy examples which illustrate some of the challenges faced in real-world applications of ABC, before turning to two demanding parameter inference problems in molecular biology, which highlight the huge increases in efficiency that can be gained from choice of optimal kernels. We conclude with a general discussion of the rational choice of perturbation kernels in ABC SMC settings.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is now the world's leading infectious killer and major programmatic advances will be needed if we are to meet the ambitious new End TB Targets. Although mathematical models are powerful tools for TB control, such models must be flexible enough to capture the complexity and heterogeneity of the global TB epidemic. This includes simulating a disease that affects age groups and other risk groups differently, has varying levels of infectiousness depending upon the organ involved and varying outcomes from treatment depending on the drug resistance pattern of the infecting strain. RESULTS: We adopted sound basic principles of software engineering to develop a modular software platform for simulation of TB control interventions ("AuTuMN"). These included object-oriented programming, logical linkage between modules and consistency of code syntax and variable naming. The underlying transmission dynamic model incorporates optional stratification by age, risk group, strain and organ involvement, while our approach to simulating time-variant programmatic parameters better captures the historical progression of the epidemic. An economic model is overlaid upon this epidemiological model which facilitates comparison between new and existing technologies. A "Model runner" module allows for predictions of future disease burden trajectories under alternative scenario situations, as well as uncertainty, automatic calibration, cost-effectiveness and optimisation. The model has now been used to guide TB control strategies across a range of settings and countries, with our modular approach enabling repeated application of the tool without the need for extensive modification for each application. CONCLUSIONS: The modular construction of the platform minimises errors, enhances readability and collaboration between multiple programmers and enables rapid adaptation to answer questions in a broad range of contexts without the need for extensive re-programming. Such features are particularly important in simulating an epidemic as complex and diverse as TB.},

abstract = {The discovery and introduction of antimicrobial agents to clinical medicine was one of the greatest medical triumphs of the 20th century that revolutionized the treatment of bacterial infections. However, the gradual emergence of populations of antimicrobial-resistant pathogenic bacteria resulting from use, misuse, and abuse of antimicrobials has today become a major global health concern. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes have been suggested to originate from environmental bacteria, as clinically relevant resistance genes have been detected on the chromosome of environmental bacteria. As only a few new antimicrobials have been developed in the last decade, the further evolution of resistance poses a serious threat to public health. Urgent measures are required not only to minimize the use of antimicrobials for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes but also to look for alternative strategies for the control of bacterial infections. This review examines the global picture of antimicrobial resistance, factors that favor its spread, strategies, and limitations for its control and the need for continuous training of all stake-holders i.e., medical, veterinary, public health, and other relevant professionals as well as human consumers, in the appropriate use of antimicrobial drugs.},

The World Health Organization is recommending policies including simultaneous use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) to treat HIV/AIDS and second line drugs to treat MDRTB. We developed a System Dynamics simulation model to represent the dynamic transmission of TB, MDRTB and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). The model simulated scenarios regarding MDRTB cure rate and HAART coverage, that is the HIV/AIDS population covered by HAART. The results over a 20-year period indicate that reduction in TB and HIV-associated TB deaths would be negligible for HAART coverage up to 50{\%}. The reduction is only significant for HAART coverage of 70{\%} and above. Similarly, high MDRTB cure rate reduces significantly deaths from TB and MDRTB and this reduction is more important as the HAART coverage is increased.

abstract = {RATIONALE: To improve the effectiveness of tuberculosis (TB) control programs in the United States by identifying cost-effective priorities for screening for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). OBJECTIVES: To estimate the cost-effectiveness of LTBI screening using the tuberculin skin test (TST)and interferon-g release assays (IGRAs). METHODS: A Markov model of screening for LTBI with TST and IGRA in risk-groups considered in current LTBI screening guidelines. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In all risk-groups, TST and IGRA screening resulted in increased mean life expectancy, ranging from 0.03-0.24 life-months per person screened. IGRA screening resulted in greater life expectancy gains than TST. Screening always cost more than not screening, but IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST in some groups. Four patterns of cost-effectiveness emerged, related to four risk categories. (1) Individuals at highest risk of TB reactivation (close contacts and those infected with HIV): the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of IGRA compared with TST was less than {\$}100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. (2) The foreign-born: IGRA was cost-saving compared with TST and cost-effective compared with no screening (ICER ,{\$}100,000 per QALY gained). (3) Vulnerable populations (e.g., homeless, drug user, or former prisoner): the ICER of TST screening was approximately {\$}100,000-{\$}150,000 per QALY gained, but IGRA was not cost-effective. (4) Medical comorbidities (e.g., diabetes): the ICER of screening with TST or IGRA was greater than {\$}100,000 per QALY. CONCLUSIONS: LTBI screening guidelines could make progress toward TB elimination by prioritizing screening for close contacts, those infected with HIV, and the foreign-born regardless of time living in the United States. For these groups, IGRA screening was more cost-effective than TST screening.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Emerging research suggests that genetically distinct strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis may modulate the immune system differently. This may be of importance in high-burden settings where {\textgreater} or =1 genetic group of M. tuberculosis confers significant morbidity. METHODS: A dynamic mathematical model was constructed to evaluate how different degrees of cross-immunity among M. tuberculosis groups could affect epidemics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB). RESULTS: Simulated populations with immunogenically distinct TB strain groups experienced a heightened risk of drug-resistant TB, compared with populations without such strain diversity, even when the same rates of case detection and treatment success were achieved. The highest risks of infection were observed in populations in which HIV was prevalent. Drug-resistant strains with very low transmission fitness could still propagate in environments with reduced cross-immunity among different strain groups, even after common targets for case detection and treatment success are reached. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the propagation of drug-resistant strains could depend not only on the rate of development of resistance and the fitness of the drug-resistant strains but, also, on the diversity of the strains in the region. The risk of infection with drug-resistant strains could be amplified in locations where there is reduced cross-immunity between originating strain groups. This amplification may be most profound during the first few decades of TB treatment expansion.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the existence of effective drug treatments, tuberculosis (TB) causes 2 million deaths annually worldwide. Effective treatment is complicated by multidrug-resistant TB (MDR TB) strains that respond only to second-line drugs. We projected the health benefits and cost-effectiveness of using drug susceptibility testing and second-line drugs in a lower-middle-income setting with high levels of MDR TB. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a dynamic state-transition model of TB. In a base case analysis, the model was calibrated to approximate the TB epidemic in Peru, a setting with a smear-positive TB incidence of 120 per 100,000 and 4.5{\%} MDR TB among prevalent cases. Secondary analyses considered other settings. The following strategies were evaluated: first-line drugs administered under directly observed therapy (DOTS), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases (STR1), locally standardized second-line drugs for previously treated cases with test-confirmed MDR TB (STR2), comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for previously treated cases (ITR1), and comprehensive drug susceptibility testing and individualized treatment for all cases (ITR2). Outcomes were costs per TB death averted and costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) gained. We found that strategies incorporating the use of second-line drug regimens following first-line treatment failure were highly cost-effective compared to strategies using first-line drugs only. In our base case, standardized second-line treatment for confirmed MDR TB cases (STR2) had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 720 dollars per QALY (8,700 dollars per averted death) compared to DOTS. Individualized second-line drug treatment for MDR TB following first-line failure (ITR1) provided more benefit at an incremental cost of 990 dollars per QALY (12,000 dollars per averted death) compared to STR2. A more aggressive version of the individualized treatment strategy (ITR2), in which both new and previously treated cases are tested for MDR TB, had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of 11,000 dollars per QALY (160,000 dollars per averted death) compared to ITR1. The STR2 and ITR1 strategies remained cost-effective under a wide range of alternative assumptions about treatment costs, effectiveness, MDR TB prevalence, and transmission. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of MDR TB using second-line drugs is highly cost-effective in Peru. In other settings, the attractiveness of strategies using second-line drugs will depend on TB incidence, MDR burden, and the available budget, but simulation results suggest that individualized regimens would be cost-effective in a wide range of situations.},

abstract = {A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine three parameters of the quality of the raw milk marketed by milk selling points (MSPs) in Dar es Salaam region. Total bacterial count (TBC) was used as an indicator of the microbial quality of the milk; antimicrobial residues were determined; and the California mastitis test (CMT) was used to screen for milk somatic cells as an indication of the mastitis level in the cows that provided the milk. Moreover, a water sample at each MSP was taken for bacteriological culturing. Finally, a questionnaire survey was conducted with the milk sellers at the MSPs to identify risk factors for poor milk hygiene. A total of 128 milk samples and corresponding water samples were collected from randomly selected milk selling points in Dar es Salaam region. The mean TBC was (8.2 +/- 1.9) x 10(6) cfu/ml, and major bacterial isolates from the milk samples were Escherichia coli (6.3{\%}), Bacillus cereus (6.3{\%}), Staphylococcus aureus (6.3{\%}) and Streptococcus agalactiae (6.3{\%}), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.6{\%}) and Enterococcus faecalis (4.7{\%}). In most cases, the organisms identified in milk corresponded to those isolated from the corresponding water samples. Of milk samples, 79.0{\%} were positive to the CMT and 7.0{\%} were positive for antimicrobial residues. TBC was normalized by log-transformation, and the possible predictors of TBC were identified by fitting two linear regression models. In a random effect model, water microbial quality, frequency of cleaning the milk containers, frequency of milk supply, milk storage time and the type of containers, and mixing of fresh and previous milk were significantly (p {\textless} 0.05) associated with the mean log TBC. In a fixed effect model, in addition to these indicators, water shortage, water source and the refrigerator condition were significantly (p {\textless} or = 0.01) associated with log TBC. It was concluded that the milk sold in Dar es Salaam region is of poor quality and is of public health significance.},

abstract = {Although almost a third of the world's population is infected with the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, our understanding of the functions of many immune factors involved in fighting infection is limited. Determining the role of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10 at the level of the granuloma has proven difficult because of lesional heterogeneity and the limitations of animal models. In this study, we take an in silico approach and, through a series of virtual experiments, we predict several novel roles for IL-10 in tuberculosis granulomas: 1) decreased levels of IL-10 lead to increased numbers of sterile lesions, but at the cost of early increased caseation; 2) small increases in early antimicrobial activity cause this increased lesion sterility; 3) IL-10 produced by activated macrophages is a major mediator of early antimicrobial activity and early host-induced caseation; and 4) increasing levels of infected macrophage derived IL-10 promotes bacterial persistence by limiting the early antimicrobial response and preventing lesion sterilization. Our findings, currently only accessible using an in silico approach, suggest that IL-10 at the individual granuloma scale is a critical regulator of lesion outcome. These predictions suggest IL-10-related mechanisms that could be used as adjunctive therapies during tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Understanding the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases is important for both biological research and public health applications. It has been widely demonstrated that statistical modeling provides a firm basis for inferring relevant epidemiological quantities from incidence and molecular data. However, the complexity of transmission dynamic models presents two challenges: (1) the likelihood function of the models is generally not computable, and computationally intensive simulation-based inference methods need to be employed, and (2) the model may not be fully identifiable from the available data. While the first difficulty can be tackled by computational and algorithmic advances, the second obstacle is more fundamental. Identifiability issues may lead to inferences that are driven more by prior assumptions than by the data themselves. We consider a popular and relatively simple yet analytically intractable model for the spread of tuberculosis based on classical IS6110 fingerprinting data. We report on the identifiability of the model, also presenting some methodological advances regarding the inference. Using likelihood approximations, we show that the reproductive value cannot be identified from the data available and that the posterior distributions obtained in previous work have likely been substantially dominated by the assumed prior distribution. Further, we show that the inferences are influenced by the assumed infectious population size, which generally has been kept fixed in previous work. We demonstrate that the infectious population size can be inferred if the remaining epidemiological parameters are already known with sufficient precision.},

We analysed two systems which contain different amount of inputs. The first system contains four inputs, the second one contains six inputs. We used the Takagi-Sugeno-Kanga model. Mamdani model is poor at representation as it needs more fuzzy rules than that of TSK to model a real world system where accuracy is demanded. It has been employed a fuzzy controller, and a fuzzy model, in successfully solving difficult control and modelling problems in practice. It is implemented in the Fuzzy Logic Toolbox in Matlab. The data for inputs are gathered in the database named SOPAT (selection of plants against tuberculosis), which is part of a project coordinated by the Oxford International Biomedical Centre. In this database there could be up to one million plant species. It would be cumbersome to select a remedy from one (or some) of these species looking at the data base one-by-one. By means of the fuzzy set theory this remedy can be chosen very quickly.},

A net reproduction number (the average number of secondary infectious cases resulting from each case in a given population) of above 1 is conventionally associated with an increase in incidence; the basic reproduction number (defined analogously for a 'totally susceptible' population) provides a standard measure of the 'transmission potential' of an infection. Using a model of the epidemiology of tuberculosis in England and Wales since 1900, we demonstrate that these measures are difficult to apply if disease can follow reinfection, and that they lose their conventional interpretations if important epidemiological parameters, such as the rate of contact between individuals, change over the time interval between successive cases in a chain of transmission (the serial interval). The net reproduction number for tuberculosis in England and Wales appears to have been approximately 1 from 1900 until 1950, despite concurrent declines in morbidity and mortality rates, and it declined rapidly in the second half of this century. The basic reproduction number declined from about 3 in 1900, reached 2 by 1950, and first fell below 1 in about 1960. Reductions in effective contact between individuals over this period, measured in terms of the average number of individuals to whom each case could transmit the infection, meant that the conventional basic reproduction number measure (which does not consider subsequent changes in epidemiological parameters) for a given year failed to reflect the 'actual transmission potential' of the infection. This latter property is better described by a variant of the conventional measure which takes secular trends in contact into account. These results are relevant for the interpretation of trends in any infectious disease for which epidemiological parameters change over time periods comparable to the infectious period, incubation period or serial interval.},

abstract = {RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Design and implement a concurrent campaign of influenza immunization and tuberculosis (TB) screening for health care workers (HCWs) that can reduce the number of clinic visits for each HCW. METHOD: A discrete-event simulation model was developed to support issues of resource allocation decisions in planning and operations phases. RESULTS: The campaign was compressed to100 days in 2010 and further compressed to 75 days in 2012 and 2013. With more than 5000 HCW arrivals in 2011, 2012 and 2013, the 14-day goal of TB results was achieved for each year and reduced to about 4 days in 2012 and 2013. CONCLUSION: Implementing a concurrent campaign allows less number of visiting clinics and the compressing of campaign length allows earlier immunization. The support of simulation modelling can provide useful evaluations of different configurations.},

abstract = {Recent data indicate that 10- to 14-mm Mycobacterium tuberculosis purified protein derivative (PPD) reactions are often due to prior infections with nontuberculous mycobacteria. Therefore, use of a 10-mm cutpoint to define latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) results in false-positive diagnoses and unnecessary treatment for LTBI. A second skin test, Mycobacterium avium sensitin (MAS), has been shown to accurately identify false-positive PPD results.To compare the costs and accuracy of a single skin-test strategy (SST) with PPD alone with a dual skin-test strategy (DST) where 10- to 14-mm PPD results are also tested with MAS.A decision analytic model was developed to evaluate the two strategies. The model accounted for the costs of skin testing, the costs of LTBI treatment, the costs of undetected LTBI, and the sensitivity and specificity of each strategy.We estimated that DST saved {\$}3 per subject tested compared to SST. Savings were due to a reduction in false-positive PPD results and consequent reduction in unnecessary treatment for LTBI of {\textgreater}60{\%}. The DST strategy was associated with a minimal increase in undetected LTBI (6{\%} vs 7{\%}). Results were stable for a broad range of parameter values.DST is a promising approach to improving the specificity of LTBI testing when a 10-mm PPD cutpoint is used and would reduce costs and unnecessary drug treatment.},

@article{Huynh2015,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the last 20 years, China ramped up a DOTS (directly observed treatment, short-course)-based tuberculosis (TB) control program with 80{\%} population coverage, achieving the 2015 Millennium Development Goal of a 50{\%} reduction in TB prevalence and mortality. Recently, the World Health Organization developed the End TB Strategy, with an overall goal of a 90{\%} reduction in TB incidence and a 95{\%} reduction in TB deaths from 2015-2035. As the TB burden shifts to older individuals and China's overall population ages, it is unclear if maintaining the current DOTS strategy will be sufficient for China to reach the global targets. METHODS: We developed an individual-based computational model of TB transmission, implementing realistic age demographics and fitting to country-level data of age-dependent prevalence over time. We explored the trajectory of TB burden if the DOTS strategy is maintained or if new interventions are introduced using currently available and soon-to-be-available tools. These interventions include increasing population coverage of DOTS, reducing time to treatment, increasing treatment success, and active case finding among elders {\textgreater} 65 years old. We also considered preventative therapy in latently infected elders, a strategy limited by resource constraints and the risk of adverse events. RESULTS: Maintenance of the DOTS strategy reduces TB incidence and mortality by 42{\%} (95{\%} credible interval, 27-59{\%}) and 41{\%} (5-64{\%}), respectively, between 2015 and 2035. A combination of all feasible interventions nears the 2035 mortality target, reducing TB incidence and mortality by 59{\%} (50-76{\%}) and 83{\%} (73-94{\%}). Addition of preventative therapy for elders would enable China to nearly reach both the incidence and mortality targets, reducing incidence and mortality by 84{\%} (78-93{\%}) and 92{\%} (86-98{\%}). CONCLUSIONS: The current decline in incidence is driven by two factors: maintaining a low level of new infections in young individuals and the aging out of older latently infected individuals who contribute incidence due to reactivation disease. While further reducing the level of new infections has a modest effect on burden, interventions that limit reactivation have a greater impact on TB burden. Tools that make preventative therapy more feasible on a large scale and in elders will help China achieve the global targets.},

We examined the percentage of purified protein derivative conversions under various exposure conditions, environmental controlstrategies, and respiratory protective devices. We conclude that environmental control cannot eliminate the risk for TB transmission during high-risk procedures; respiratory protective devices, and particularly high-efficiency particulate air masks, may provide nearly complete protection if used with air filtration or ultraviolet irradiation. Nevertheless, the efficiency of these control measures decreases as the infectivity of the source case increases. Therefore, administrative control measures (e.g., indentifying and isolating patients with infectious TB) are the most effective because they substantially reduce the rate of infection.},

abstract = {The dominant approach to decision-making in public health policy for infectious diseases relies heavily on expert opinion, which often applies empirical evidence to policy questions in a manner that is neither systematic nor transparent. Although systematic reviews are frequently commissioned to inform specific components of policy (such as efficacy), the same process is rarely applied to the full decision-making process. Mathematical models provide a mechanism through which empirical evidence can be methodically and transparently integrated to address such questions. However, such models are often considered difficult to interpret. In addition, models provide estimates that need to be iteratively re-evaluated as new data or considerations arise. Using the case study of a novel diagnostic for tuberculosis, a framework for improved collaboration between public health decision-makers and mathematical modellers that could lead to more transparent and evidence-driven policy decisions for infectious diseases in the future is proposed. The framework proposes that policymakers should establish long-term collaborations with modellers to address key questions, and that modellers should strive to provide clear explanations of the uncertainty of model structure and outputs. Doing so will improve the applicability of models and clarify their limitations when used to inform real-world public health policy decisions.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate whether methodological optimization of serial sputum colony counting (SSCC) studies, a potentially important component in the drug development process for tuberculosis, could significantly improve their power. METHODS: Simulations were carried out using a model derived from a large SSCC dataset. Variance inflation factors (VIFs) were calculated for model parameters, focusing on the elimination rate constant likely to reflect 'sterilizing' activity and sampling schemes were optimized relative to a scheme of daily sampling during the initial phase of therapy. Corresponding sample sizes required for SSCC studies using different schemes were also computed. RESULTS: Published sampling schemes lacked efficiency with respect to the 'sterilizing' phase. Pragmatic optimized schemes yielding greatest precision were achieved using eleven sampling points around a skeleton of 0, 2, 7, 14 and 56 days. The standard error of the 'sterilizing' rate constant was reduced more than 4-fold, and sample size for realistic treatment effects was effectively halved. Even schemes with a restricted duration of sampling to avoid high proportions of missing data and those with fewer sampling points still achieved significant gains in precision. Sensitivity analysis suggested that such schemes should continue to perform well over the immediately foreseeable range of improvements in therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Methodological improvements in the design of SSCC studies could make them a powerful tool in Phase II development of anti-tuberculosis agents.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regimens for isoniazid-based preventive therapy (IPT) for tuberculosis (TB) in HIV-infected individuals have not been widely adopted given concerns regarding efficacy, adherence and drug resistance. Further, the cost-effectiveness of IPT has not been studied in India. METHODS: We used an HIV/TB model to project TB incidence, life expectancy, cost and incremental cost-effectiveness of six months of isoniazid plus ethambutol (6EH), thirty-six months of isoniazid (36H) and no IPT for HIV-infected patients in India. Model input parameters included a median CD4 count of 324 cells/mm(3), and a rate ratio of developing TB of 0.35 for 6EH and 0.22 for 36H at three years as compared to no IPT. Results of 6EH and 36H were also compared to six months of isoniazid (6H), three months of isoniazid plus rifampin (3RH) and three months of isoniazid plus rifapentine (3RPTH). RESULTS: Projected TB incidence decreased in the 6EH and 36H regimens by 51{\%} and 62{\%} respectively at three-year follow-up compared to no IPT. Without IPT, projected life expectancy was 136.1 months at a lifetime per person cost of {\$}5,630. 6EH increased life expectancy by 0.8 months at an additional per person cost of {\$}100 (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of {\$}1,490/year of life saved (YLS)). 36H further increased life expectancy by 0.2 months with an additional per person cost of {\$}55 (ICER of {\$}3,120/YLS). The projected clinical impact of 6EH was comparable to 6H and 3RH; however when compared to these other options, 6EH was no longer cost-effective given the high cost of ethambutol. Results were sensitive to baseline CD4 count and adherence. CONCLUSIONS: Three, six and thirty-six-month regimens of isoniazid-based therapy are effective in preventing TB. Three months of isoniazid plus rifampin and six-months of isoniazid are similarly cost-effective in India, and should be considered part of HIV care.},

abstract = {In this work, we examine practical aspects of backward bifurcation for a data-based model of tuberculosis that incorporates multiple features which have previously been shown to produce backward bifurcation (e.g. exogenous reinfection and imperfect vaccination) and new considerations such as the treatment of latent TB infection (LTBI) and the BCG vaccine's interference with detecting LTBI. Understanding the interplay between these multiple factors and backward bifurcation is particularly timely given that new diagnostic tests for LTBI detection could dramatically increase rates of both LTBI detection and vaccination in the coming decades. By establishing analytic thresholds for the existence of backward bifurcation, we identify those aspects of TB's complicated pathology that make backward bifurcation more or less likely to occur. We also examine the magnitude of the backward bifurcation produced by the model and its sensitivity to various model parameters. We find that backward bifurcation is unlikely to occur. While increased vaccine coverage and/or increased detection and treatment of LTBI can push the threshold for backward bifurcation into the region of biological plausibility, the resulting bifurcations may still be too small to have any noticeable epidemiological impact.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: After infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, children are at an increased risk of progression to tuberculosis disease; a condition that can be challenging to diagnose. New estimation approaches for children have highlighted the gap between incidence and notifications of M tuberculosis, and suggest there are more cases of isoniazid-resistant and multidrug-resistant (MDR) disease than are identified. No work has yet quantified the burden of drug-resistant infection, or accounted for other types of drug resistance or sampling uncertainty. METHODS: We combined a mathematical model of tuberculosis in children with an analysis of drug-resistance patterns to produce country-level, regional, and global estimates of drug-resistant infection and disease. We determined drug resistance using data from the Global Project on Antituberculosis Drug Resistance Surveillance at WHO, from surveys and surveillance reported between 1988 and 2014. We combined 1000 sampled proportions for each country from a Bayesian approach with 10 000 sampled country estimates of tuberculosis disease incidence and M tuberculosis infection prevalence. We estimated the proportions of tuberculosis cases at a country level with isoniazid monoresistance, rifampicin monoresistance, multidrug resistance (MDR), fluoroquinolone-resistant multidrug resistance, second-line injectable-resistant multidrug resistance, and extensive multidrug resistance with resistance to both a fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable (XDR). FINDINGS: We estimated that 850 000 children developed tuberculosis in 2014; 58 000 with isoniazid-monoresistant tuberculosis, 25 000 with MDR tuberculosis, and 1200 with XDR tuberculosis. We estimate 67 million children are infected with M tuberculosis; 5 million with isoniazid monoresistance, 2 million with MDR, and 100 000 with XDR. Africa and southeast Asia have the highest numbers of children with tuberculosis, but the WHO Eastern Mediterranean region, European region, and Western Pacific region also contribute substantially to the burden of drug-resistant tuberculosis because of their much higher proportions of resistance. INTERPRETATION: Far more drug-resistant tuberculosis occurs in children than is diagnosed, and there is a large pool of drug-resistant infection. This finding has implications for approaches to empirical treatment and preventive therapy in some regions of the world. FUNDING: UNITAID.},

abstract = {A decision analysis was conducted to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of programs in which the Amplified Mycobacterium Tuberculosis Direct test (MTD) (Gen-Probe) is used to rapidly exclude Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex as a cause of disease in smear-positive respiratory specimens. MTD sensitivity, specificity, and probability of inhibition for smear-positive specimens were estimated from literature reports. Costs and laboratory performance characteristics were determined from review of records and practices at an urban hospital in the mid-Atlantic United States. In the base case, 31.4{\%} of smear-positive specimens were assumed to be culture positive for M. tuberculosis. Under these conditions, the marginal cost of the MTD testing program was estimated as {\$}338 per smear-positive patient, or {\$}494 per early exclusion of tuberculosis based on negative MTD results. By comparison, the cost of respiratory isolation ({\$}27.77/day) and drugs ({\$}5.66/day) averted by MTD testing was estimated at {\$}201 per early tuberculosis exclusion. MTD testing was therefore not cost-effective in this scenario. Sensitivity analysis revealed that cost-effectiveness estimates are sensitive to the number of smear-positive specimens processed annually, the relative prevalence of M. tuberculosis in smear-positive specimens, and the marginal daily cost of respiratory isolation. A decision tool is therefore presented for assessing the cost-effectiveness of MTD under various combinations of those three variables. While routine MTD testing of smear-positive specimens is not expected to be cost-saving for most individual hospitals, centralized reference laboratories may be able to implement MTD in a cost-effective manner across a wide range of situations.},

abstract = {This report presents detailed data on TB case notifications made to the Enhanced Tuberculosis Surveillance system (ETS) in England to the end of 2014. This is a change in presentation compared with previous TB annual reports produced by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) and Public Health England (PHE), which reported detailed surveillance data for the whole of the UK. This change is consistent with the newly launched Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020 [1], and the fact that TB control activities, along with other health services, are devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The one exception is the United Kingdom tuberculosis pre-entry screening programme (chapter 10), which is conducted for the whole of the UK. High-level data on TB notifications in the UK to the end of 2014, and breakdowns by country, can be found in the Official Statistic for TB, ‘Reports of cases of tuberculosis to enhanced tuberculosis surveillance systems: United Kingdom, 2000 to 2014'. This is available at https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/tuberculosis-and-othermycobacterial-diseases-diagnosis-screening-management-and-data. As part of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020, a suite of TB Strategy Monitoring Indicators have been developed (https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment{\_}data/file/403231/ Collaborative{\_}TB{\_}Strategy{\_}for{\_}England{\_}2015{\_}2020{\_}.pdf). Where data for these indicators are presented in this report, the indicator name is shown, and a summary table of national-level indicators is presented in Appendix V. Data for indicators which are presented at Upper Tier Local Authority can be found at http://fingertips.phe.org.uk/profile/tb-monitoring and will be updated with data for 2014 on 6th October 2015. Hyperlinks (in green) for specific indicators are also shown throughout the report where data are presented. TB data from 2000 are updated annually to take into account denotifications, late notifications and other updates. The data from the current year's report supersedes data in previous reports. Key points and recommendations This report presents detailed data on the occurrence and management of tuberculosis (TB) in England to the end of 2014, which should be used to inform the implementation of the Collaborative TB Strategy for England 2015-2020.  in the past three years there has been a year on year decline in the number of TB cases in England, down to 6,520 in 2014, a rate of 12.0 per 100,000 o despite this decline, the number of TB cases in England is still unacceptably high  the recent reduction in TB cases is mainly due to a reduction in cases in the nonUK born population, which make up nearly three-quarters of all TB cases in England o this reduction is likely in part to reflect recent declines in the number of migrants from high TB burden countries and the impact of pre-entry TB screening o the majority of non-UK born cases (86{\%}) are now notified more than two years after entering the UK, and are likely to be due to reactivation of latent TB infection o the roll out of latent TB testing and treatment, and further strengthening of TB services is required to ensure that the decline in non-UK born cases is sustained  there has been no downward trend in the incidence of TB in the UK born population in the past decade, with a rate of 3.9 per 100,000 in 2014 o 15{\%} of cases in the UK born population had at least one social risk factor, and 38{\%} were from minority ethnic groups  there is some evidence of a recent reduction in transmission of TB in England, with a decline in TB incidence in UK born children in the past six years o more substantial reductions in transmission will require improvements in early diagnosis, contact tracing and further improvements in treatment completion  treatment completion for drug sensitive cases has been improving over the past decade, with corresponding reductions in deaths and losses to follow-up  there has been a recent reduction in the number of new cases of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR-TB), with 52 new cases diagnosed in 2014  nearly half of drug resistant cases with MDR/rifampicin resistant-TB (MDR/RRTB) notified in 2012 had not completed treatment by 24 months; these patients require specialised clinical management and considerable social support to achieve favourable outcomes Tuberculosis in England: 2015 report (presenting data to end of 2014) 8  the average delay from symptom onset to treatment start is unacceptably long and increasing; nearly one-third of pulmonary TB cases had a delay of more than four months in 2014 o to reduce this delay, improved awareness in affected communities and among health professionals, and improved access to high quality services are required  nearly one in ten TB cases in 2014 had at least one social risk factor, and there has been no reduction in the number of cases with social risk factors over the past five years o a higher proportion of those with social risk factors have drug resistant TB and worse TB outcomes, which highlights the added importance of tackling TB in this group, including through targeted outreach services  to achieve further reductions in TB in England over the next five years, including in new and settled migrant populations, in the UK born population, and among the most vulnerable groups, we need to build upon existing achievements and address gaps in current service provision; this will require the sustained and coordinated action of all key stakeholders, supported and overseen by the newly established TB control boards and national TB programme office},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the duration of protection by bacillus Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) may exceed previous estimates with potential implications for estimating clinical and cost-efficacy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVES: To estimate the protection and duration of protection provided by BCG vaccination against tuberculosis, explore how this protection changes with time since vaccination, and examine the reasons behind the variation in protection and the rate of waning of protection.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDATA SOURCES: Electronic databases including MEDLINE, Excerpta Medica Database (EMBASE), Cochrane Databases, NHS Economic Evaluation Database (NHS EED), Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE), Web of Knowledge, Biosciences Information Service (BIOSIS), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature (LILACs), MEDCARIB Database, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) were searched from inception to May 2009. Index to Theses, System for Information on Grey Literature in Europe (SIGLE), Centre for Agricultural Bioscience International (CABI) Abstracts, Scopus, Article First, Academic Complete, Africa-Wide Information, Google Scholar, Global Health, British National Bibliography for Report Literature, and clinical trial registration websites were searched from inception to October 2009.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nREVIEW METHODS: Electronic databases searches, screening of identified studies, data extraction and analysis were undertaken. Meta-analysis was used to present numerical and graphical summaries of clinical efficacy and efficacy by time since vaccination. Evidence of heterogeneity was assessed using the tau-squared statistic. Meta-regression allowed the investigation of observed heterogeneity. Factors investigated included BCG strain, latitude, stringency of pre-BCG vaccination tuberculin testing, age at vaccination, site of disease, study design and vulnerability to biases. Rate of waning of protection was estimated using the ratio of the measure of efficacy after 10 years compared with the efficacy in the first 10 years of a study.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Study selection. A total of 21,030 references were identified, providing data on 132 studies after abstract and full-text review. Efficacy. Protection against pulmonary tuberculosis in adults is variable, ranging from substantial protection in the UK MRC trial {\{}rate ratio 0.22 [95{\%} confidence interval (CI) 0.16 to 0.31]{\}}, to absence of clinically important benefit, as in the large Chingleput trial [rate ratio 1.05 (95{\%} CI 0.88 to 1.25)] and greater in latitudes further away from the equator. BCG vaccination efficacy was usually high, and varied little by form of disease (with higher protection against meningeal and miliary tuberculosis) or study design when BCG vaccination was given only to infants or to children after strict screening for tuberculin sensitivity. High levels of protection against death were observed from both trials and observational studies. The observed protective effect of BCG vaccination did not differ by the strain of BCG vaccine used in trials.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDURATION: Reviewed studies showed that BCG vaccination protects against pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis for up to 10 years. Most studies either did not follow up participants for long enough or had very few cases after 15 years. This should not be taken to indicate an absence of effect: five studies (one trial and four observational studies) provided evidence of measurable protection at least 15 years after vaccination. Efficacy declined with time. The rate of decline was variable, with faster decline in latitudes further from the equator and in situations where BCG vaccination was given to tuberculin-sensitive participants after stringent tuberculin testing.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nLIMITATIONS: The main limitation of this review relates to quality of included trials, most of which were conducted before current standards for reporting were formulated. In addition, data were lacking in some areas and the review had to rely on evidence from observational studies.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: BCG vaccination protection against tuberculosis varies between populations, to an extent that cannot be attributed to chance alone. Failure to exclude those already sensitised to mycobacteria and study latitude closer to the equator were associated with lower efficacy. These factors explained most of the observed variation. There is good evidence that BCG vaccination protection declines with time and that protection can last for up to 10 years. Data on protection beyond 15 years are limited; however, a small number of trials and observational studies suggest that BCG vaccination may protect for longer. Further studies are required to investigate the duration of protection by BCG vaccination.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nFUNDING: The National Institute for Health Research Health Technology Assessment programme.},

@article{VanKleef2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dynamic transmission models are increasingly being used to improve our understanding of the epidemiology of healthcare-associated infections (HCAI). However, there has been no recent comprehensive review of this emerging field. This paper summarises how mathematical models have informed the field of HCAI and how methods have developed over time.

METHODS: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, CINAHL plus and Global Health databases were systematically searched for dynamic mathematical models of HCAI transmission and/or the dynamics of antimicrobial resistance in healthcare settings.

RESULTS: In total, 96 papers met the eligibility criteria. The main research themes considered were evaluation of infection control effectiveness (64{\%}), variability in transmission routes (7{\%}), the impact of movement patterns between healthcare institutes (5{\%}), the development of antimicrobial resistance (3{\%}), and strain competitiveness or co-colonisation with different strains (3{\%}). Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus was the most commonly modelled HCAI (34{\%}), followed by vancomycin resistant enterococci (16{\%}). Other common HCAIs, e.g. Clostridum difficile, were rarely investigated (3{\%}). Very few models have been published on HCAI from low or middle-income countries.The first HCAI model has looked at antimicrobial resistance in hospital settings using compartmental deterministic approaches. Stochastic models (which include the role of chance in the transmission process) are becoming increasingly common. Model calibration (inference of unknown parameters by fitting models to data) and sensitivity analysis are comparatively uncommon, occurring in 35{\%} and 36{\%} of studies respectively, but their application is increasing. Only 5{\%} of models compared their predictions to external data.

CONCLUSIONS: Transmission models have been used to understand complex systems and to predict the impact of control policies. Methods have generally improved, with an increased use of stochastic models, and more advanced methods for formal model fitting and sensitivity analyses. Insights gained from these models could be broadened to a wider range of pathogens and settings. Improvements in the availability of data and statistical methods could enhance the predictive ability of models.},

abstract = {Background: Neonatal BCG vaccination is part of routine vaccination schedules in many developing countries; vaccination at school age has not been assessed in trials in low-income and middle-income countries. Catch-up BCG vaccination of school-age children who missed neonatal BCG vaccination could be indicated if it confers protection and is cost-effective. We did a cluster-randomised trial (BCG REVAC) to estimate the effectiveness (efficacy given in routine settings) of school-age vaccination. Methods: We assessed the effectiveness of BCG vaccination in school-age children (aged 7-14 years) with unknown tuberculin status who did not receive neonatal BCG vaccination (subpopulation of the BCG REVAC cluster-randomised trial), between July, 1997, and June, 2006, in Salvador, Brazil, and between January, 1999, and December, 2007, in Manaus, Brazil. 763 schools were randomly assigned into BCG vaccination group or a not-vaccinated control group. Neither allocation nor intervention was concealed. Incidence of tuberculosis was the primary outcome. Cases were identified via the Brazilian Tuberculosis Control Programme. Study staff were masked to vaccination status when identified cases were linked to the study population. We estimated cost-effectiveness in Salvador by comparison of the cost for vaccination to prevent one case of tuberculosis (censored at 9 years) with the average cost of treating one case of tuberculosis. Analysis of all included children was by intention to treat. For calculation of the incidence rate we used generalised estimating equations and correlated observations over time. Findings: We randomly assigned 20 622 children from 385 schools to the BCG vaccination group and 18 507 children from 365 schools to the control group. The crude incidence of tuberculosis was 54{\textperiodcentered}9 (95{\%} CI 45{\textperiodcentered}3-66{\textperiodcentered}7) per 100 000 person-years in the BCG vaccination group and 72{\textperiodcentered}7 (62{\textperiodcentered}8-86{\textperiodcentered}8) per 100 000 person-years in the control group. The overall vaccine effectiveness of a first BCG vaccination at school age was 25{\%} (3-43{\%}). In Salvador, where vaccine effectiveness was 34{\%} (8-53{\%}), vaccination of 381 children would prevent one case of tuberculosis and was cheaper than treatment. The frequency of adverse events was very low with only one axillary lymphadenitis and one ulcer greater than 1 cm in 11 980 BCG vaccinations. Interpretation: Vaccination of school-age children without previous tuberculin testing can reduce the incidence of tuberculosis and could reduce the costs of tuberculosis control.

abstract = {Over the past decade, several countries across all regions, income groups and procurement methods have been unable to secure sufficient BCG vaccine supply. While the frequency of stock-outs has remained rather stable, duration increased in 2014-2015 due to manufacturing issues and attracted the attention of national, regional and global immunization stakeholders. This prompted an in-depth analysis of supply and demand dynamics aiming to characterize supply risks. This analysis is unique as it provides a global picture, where previous analyses have focused on a portion of the market procuring through UN entities. Through literature review, supplier interviews, appraisal of shortages, stock-outs and historical procurement data, and through demand forecasting, this analysis shows an important increase in global capacity in 2017: supply is sufficient to meet forecasted BCG vaccine demand and possibly buffer market shocks. Nevertheless, risks remain mainly due to supply concentration and limited investment in production process improvements, as well as inflexibility in demand. Identification of these market risks will allow implementation of risk-mitigating interventions in three areas: (1) enhancing information sharing between major global health actors, countries and suppliers, (2) identifying interests and incentives to expand product registration and investment in the BCG manufacturing process, and (3) working with countries for tighter vaccine management.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the benefits of tuberculosis (TB) treatment with TB and HIV prevention for the control of TB in regions with high HIV prevalence. DESIGN AND METHODS: A compartmental difference equation model of TB and HIV has been developed and fitted to time series and other published data using Bayesian methods. The model is used to compare the effectiveness of TB chemotherapy with three strategies for prevention: highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the treatment of latent TB infection (TLTI) and the reduction of HIV transmission. RESULTS: Even where the prevalence of HIV infection is high, finding and curing active TB is the most effective way to minimize the number of TB cases and deaths over the next 10 years. HAART can be as effective, but only with very high levels of coverage and compliance. TLTI is comparatively ineffective over all time scales. Reducing HIV incidence is relatively ineffective in preventing TB and TB deaths over 10 years but is much more effective over 20 years. CONCLUSIONS: In countries where the spread of HIV has led to a substantial increase in the incidence of TB, TB control programmes should maintain a strong emphasis on the treatment of active TB. To ensure effective control of TB in the longer term, methods of TB prevention should be carried out in addition to, but not as a substitute for, treating active cases.},

abstract = {One problem associated with regimen-based development of anti-tuberculosis (anti-TB) drugs is the difficulty of a systematic and thorough in vivo evaluation of the large number of possible regimens that arise from consideration of multiple drugs tested together. A mathematical model capable of simulating the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of experimental combination chemotherapy of TB offers a way to mitigate this problem by extending the use of available data to investigate regimens that are not initially tested. In order to increase the available mathematical tools needed to support such a model for preclinical anti-TB drug development, we constructed a preliminary whole-body physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of rifampin in mice, using data from the literature. Interindividual variability was approximated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulation with assigned probability distributions for the model parameters. An MC sensitivity analysis was also performed to determine correlations between model parameters and plasma concentration to inform future model development. Model predictions for rifampin concentrations in plasma, liver, kidneys, and lungs, following oral administration, were generally in agreement with published experimental data from multiple studies. Sensitive model parameters included those descriptive of oral absorption, total clearance, and partitioning of rifampin between blood and muscle. This PBPK model can serve as a starting point for the integration of rifampin pharmacokinetics in mice into a larger mathematical framework, including the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, and pharmacokinetic models for other anti-TB drugs.},

abstract = {Clinical strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis can be divided into three principal genetic groups based on the single-nucleotide polymorphisms at the katG gene codon 463 and the gyrA gene codon 95. One subgroup of genetic group 1, the Beijing/W lineage, has been widely studied because of its worldwide distribution and association with outbreaks. In order to increase our understanding of the clinical and epidemiological relevance of the genetic grouping of M. tuberculosis clinical strains and the Beijing/W lineage, we investigated the genetic grouping of 679 clinical isolates of M. tuberculosis, representing 96.3{\%} of culture-confirmed tuberculosis cases diagnosed in Arkansas between January 1996 and December 2000 using PCR and DNA sequencing. We assessed the associations of infections by different genetic groups of M. tuberculosis strains and infection by the Beijing/W lineage strains with the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the patients using chi-square tests and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Of the 679 study isolates, 676 fell into one of the three principal genetic groups, with 63 (9.3{\%}) in group 1, 438 (64.8{\%}) in group 2, and 175 (25.9{\%}) in group 3. After adjusting for potential confounding of age, gender, race/ethnicity, human immunodeficiency virus serostatus, and plcD genotype in a multivariate logistic regression model, patients infected by the Beijing/W lineage isolates were nearly three times as likely as patients infected with the non-Beijing/W lineage isolates to have an extrathoracic involvement (odds ratio [95{\%} confidence interval], 2.85 [1.33, 6.12]). Thus, the Beijing/W lineage strains may have some special biological features that facilitate the development of extrathoracic tuberculosis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Nearly the entire population of Japan has been vaccinated with Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), which causes a false-positive result in the tuberculin skin test (TST). The interferon-gamma release assay QuantiFERON-TB Gold (QFT) is a new alternative to the TST that can be used to screen for latent tuberculosis infection and active tuberculosis, as it has no cross-reactivity with BCG. METHODS: We constructed a Markov model to evaluate the cost effectiveness of the QFT for tuberculosis contact screening. The target population is a hypothetical cohort of 1000 immunocompetent 20-year-old individuals who have had contact with sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis patients. The analysis was conducted from a societal perspective over the lifetime of a contact. We compared the QFT-alone strategy with the TST followed by QFT (TST/QFT) strategy and the TST-alone strategy. RESULTS: In a base-case analysis, the QFT-alone strategy was dominant ({\$}US 471.54; 28.1099 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), compared with the TST/QFT strategy ({\$}US 500.55; 28.1087 QALYs) and the TST-alone strategy ({\$}US573.98; 28.1079 QALYs). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of the QFT-alone strategy was a cost saving of {\$}US23 043.5/QALY gained compared with the TST/QFT strategy. On one-way sensitivity analysis, TST specificity and the prevalence of tuberculosis/latent tuberculosis infection affected the cost effectiveness. The probabilistic analysis showed that the QFT-alone strategy has a 95{\%} chance of being cost effective at a threshold ratio of {\$}US2.10/QALY gained, compared with the TST/QFT strategy. CONCLUSION: The QFT-alone strategy is the most cost effective for tuberculosis contact screening in Japan.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis (TB) is still amongst the most important causes of human morbidity and mortality, killing approximately two million people each year. Standard short-course chemotherapy (SSCC) can rapidly control illness and dramatically reduce the chance of death, but the impact of treatment has rarely been evaluated in these terms. METHOD: We developed a mathematical model that makes use of routinely-collected data to calculate the number of deaths directly prevented by TB treatment (i.e. excluding those due to reduced transmission). The method was applied to the world's largest TB control programme covering over 500 million people in 12 provinces of China. RESULTS: Counties which had been enrolled in the programme since 1991 were, by 1997, preventing at least 46{\%} (37-56{\%}) of the TB deaths that would otherwise have occurred. If replicated across the entire TB control programme area, this would amount to 30 000 (range 26 000-59 000) deaths directly prevented each year. CONCLUSIONS: Short-course chemotherapy has substantially reduced TB mortality in half of China. The analytical method described here could be applied to TB control operations in many other countries, and should help to quantify the true burden of tuberculosis alleviated by SSCC.},

Second, we describe models for the evolution of M. tuberculosis within and between hosts, and how the resulting diversity of strains can be assessed by considering the evolutionary relationships among different strains. Third, we discuss developments in integrating evolutionary and epidemiological models to analyse M. tuberculosis genetic sequencing data.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To estimate the impact of new tuberculosis diagnostics on tuberculosis transmission given the complex contextual factors that can lead to patient loss before diagnosis or treatment. METHODS: An epidemic model of tuberculosis specifying discrete steps along the tuberculosis diagnostic pathway was constructed. The model was calibrated to the epidemiology of tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in the United Republic of Tanzania and was used to assess the impact of a new diagnostic tool with 70{\%} sensitivity for smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis. The influence of contextual factors on the projected epidemic impact of the new diagnostic tool over the decade following introduction was explored. FINDINGS: With the use of smear microscopy, the incidence of tuberculosis will decline by an average of 3.94{\%} per year. If the new tool is added, incidence will decline by an annual 4.25{\%}. This represents an absolute change of 0.31 percentage points (95{\%} confidence interval: 0.04-0.42). However, the annual decline in transmission with use of the new tool is less when existing strategies for the diagnosis of smear-negative cases have high sensitivity and when symptomatic individuals delay in seeking care. Other influential contextual factors include access to tuberculosis care, patient loss before diagnosis, initial patient default after diagnosis and treatment success rate. CONCLUSION: When implementing and scaling up the use of a new diagnostic tool, the operational context in which diagnosis and treatment take place needs to be considered.},

Uncertainty in model parameters and in the projections is represented by fuzzy numbers. Projections are made under the assumption that current TB control measures will remain unchanged for the projection period. The projections of the model demonstrate an intermediate increase in national TB incidence (similar to that which actually occurred) followed by continuing decline. The rate of decline depends strongly on geographic, racial, and ethnic characteristics. The model predicts that the rate of decline in the number of cases among Hispanics will be slower than among white non-Hispanics and black non-Hispanics a prediction supported by the most recent data.},

We present a tuberculosis dynamics model taking into account the fact that some people in the population are smoking in order to assess the effects of smoking on tuberculosis transmission. The epidemic thresholds known as the reproduction numbers and equilibria for the model are determined and stabilities analyzed. Qualitative analysis of the model including positivity and persistence of solutions are presented. The model is numerically analyzed to assess the effects of smoking on the transmission dynamics of tuberculosis. Numerical simulations of the model show that smoking enhances tuberculosis transmission, progression to active disease and in a population of smokers, tuberculosis cannot be controlled even when treatment success is assumed to be as high as 88{\%}. Further, analysis of the reproduction numbers indicates that the number of active tuberculosis cases increases as the number of smokers increase.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) continues to present an insurmountable health burden in the Western Cape Province of South Africa. TB dynamics in adults is different from that in children, with the former determining the latter. Because the dynamics of TB are largely dependent on age, planning for interventions requires reasonable and realistic projections of the incidence across ages. It is thus important to model the dynamics of TB using mathematical models as predictive tools. We considered a TB compartmental model that is age dependent and whose parameters are set as functions of age. The model was fitted to the TB incidence data from the Cape Town metropole. The effective contact rate, a function of both age and time, was changed to fit the model to the notification rates of active TB disease cases. Our simulations illustrate that age structure plays an important role in the dynamics of TB. Projections on the future of the epidemic were made for each age group. The projected results show that TB incidence is likely to increase in the lower age groups of the population. It is clearly evident that even very simple models when applied to limited data can actually give valuable insights. Our results show that the age groups who have the highest incidence rates of active TB disease have the highest contribution in the transmission of TB. Furthermore, interventions should be targeted in the age group 25-34 years.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains the leading cause of death in South Africa. A number of potential new TB vaccine candidates have been identified and are currently in clinical trials. One such candidate is MVA85A. This study aimed to estimate the cost-effectiveness of adding the MVA85A vaccine as a booster to the BCG vaccine in children from the perspective of the South African government.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nMETHODS: The cost-effectiveness was assessed by employing Decision Analytic Modelling, through the use of a Markov model. The model compared the existing strategy of BCG vaccination to a new strategy in which infants receive BCG and a booster vaccine, MVA85A, at 4 months of age. The costs and outcomes of the two strategies are estimated through modelling the vaccination of a hypothetical cohort of newborns and following them from birth through to 10 years of age, employing 6-monthly cycles.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that the MVA85A strategy is both more costly and more effective - there are fewer TB cases and deaths from TB than BCG alone. The South African government would need to spend an additional USD 1,105 for every additional TB case averted and USD 284,017 for every additional TB death averted. The threshold analysis shows that, if the efficacy of the MVA85A vaccine was 41.3{\%} (instead of the current efficacy of 17.3{\%}), the two strategies would have the same cost but more cases of TB and more deaths from TB would be prevented by adding the MVA85A vaccine to the BCG vaccine. In this case, the government chould consider the MVA85A strategy.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: At the current level of efficacy, the MVA85A vaccine is neither effective nor cost-effective and, therefore, not a good use of limited resources. Nevertheless, this study contributes to developing a standardized Markov model, which could be used, in the future, to estimate the potential cost-effectiveness of new TB vaccines compared to the BCG vaccine, in children between the ages of 0-10 years. It also provides an indicative threshold of vaccine efficacy, which could guide future development.},

We begin by presenting an HIV/AIDS-TB coinfection model and analyze the TB and HIV/AIDS submodels separately without any intervention strategy. The TB-only model is shown to exhibit backward bifurcation when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. On the other hand, the HIV/AIDS-only model has a globally asymptotically stable disease-free equilibrium when its corresponding reproduction number is less than unity. We proceed to analyze the full HIV-TB coinfection model and extend the model to incorporate antiretroviral therapy for the AIDS cases and treatment of active and latent forms of TB. The thresholds and equilibria quantities for the models are determined and stabilities analyzed. From the study we conclude that treatment of AIDS cases results in a significant reductions of numbers of individuals progressing to active TB. Further, treatment of latent and active forms of TB results in delayed onset of the AIDS stage of HIV infection.},

abstract = {Biologically related processes operate across multiple spatiotemporal scales. For computational modeling methodologies to mimic this biological complexity, individual scale models must be linked in ways that allow for dynamic exchange of information across scales. A powerful methodology is to combine a discrete modeling approach, agent-based models (ABMs), with continuum models to form hybrid models. Hybrid multi-scale ABMs have been used to simulate emergent responses of biological systems. Here, we review two aspects of hybrid multi-scale ABMs: linking individual scale models and efficiently solving the resulting model. We discuss the computational choices associated with aspects of linking individual scale models while simultaneously maintaining model tractability. We demonstrate implementations of existing numerical methods in the context of hybrid multi-scale ABMs. Using an example model describing Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection, we show relative computational speeds of various combinations of numerical methods. Efficient linking and solution of hybrid multi-scale ABMs is key to model portability, modularity, and their use in understanding biological phenomena at a systems level.},

Numerical simulations for this variable-order fractional model are the main aim of this work, where the variable-order fractional derivative is defined in the sense of Grunwald-Letnikov definition. Two numerical methods are presented for this model, the standard finite difference method (SFDM) and nonstandard finite difference method (NSFDM).

abstract = {Current tuberculosis notification rates in South Africa are among the highest ever recorded. Although the human immunodeficiency virus epidemic has been a critical factor, the density of respiratory contacts in high-risk environments may be an important and underappreciated driver. Using a modified Wells-Riley model for airborne disease transmission, we estimated the risk of tuberculosis transmission on 3 modes of public transit (minibus taxis, buses, and trains) in Cape Town, South Africa, using exhaled carbon dioxide as a natural tracer gas to evaluate air exchange. Carbon dioxide measurements were performed between October and December of 2011. Environmental risk, reflected in the rebreathed fraction of air, was highest in minibus taxis and lowest in trains; however, the average number of passengers sharing an indoor space was highest in trains and lowest in minibus taxis. Among daily commuters, the annual risk of tuberculosis infection was projected to be 3.5{\%}-5.0{\%} and was highest among minibus taxi commuters. Assuming a duration of infectiousness of 1 year, the basic reproductive number attributable to transportation was more than 1 in all 3 modes of transportation. Given its poor ventilation and high respiratory contact rates, public transportation may play a critical role in sustaining tuberculosis transmission in South African cities.},

abstract = {A nonlinear mathematical model is proposed and analyzed to study the dynamics of HIV, TB and co-infection. The basic reproduction number for each of the two diseases (HIV and TB) is obtained. Four equilibrium points are found, out of which one is disease free equilibrium while the remaining three equilibrium points are such that they are having at least one of the diseases HIV and / or TB is present. When the basic reproduction number of the two diseases is less than one then the disease free equilibrium point is stable. This provides a threshold for the control of diseases. When TB free equilibrium point exists then it is locally stable if the basic reproduction number of HIV is more than that of TB. A condition for local stability of HIV free equilibrium point is also obtained. There exist some situations in which bi-stability is possible, that is, both of the diseases persist. The conditions for global stability of these points are also established. The conditions for existence of endemic equilibrium point are explored and it was found that it remains unstable whenever the endemic equilibrium point exists. The instability of endemic equilibrium point is used to interpret that the co-infection is not long lasting. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

@article{Marino2016a,
abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is a world-wide health problem with approximately 2 billion people infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb, the causative bacterium of TB). The pathologic hallmark of Mtb infection in humans and Non-Human Primates (NHPs) is the formation of spherical structures, primarily in lungs, called granulomas. Infection occurs after inhalation of bacteria into lungs, where resident antigen-presenting cells (APCs), take up bacteria and initiate the immune response to Mtb infection. APCs traffic from the site of infection (lung) to lung-draining lymph nodes (LNs) where they prime T cells to recognize Mtb. These T cells, circulating back through blood, migrate back to lungs to perform their immune effector functions. We have previously developed a hybrid agent-based model (ABM, labeled GranSim) describing in silico immune cell, bacterial (Mtb) and molecular behaviors during tuberculosis infection and recently linked that model to operate across three physiological compartments: lung (infection site where granulomas form), lung draining lymph node (LN, site of generation of adaptive immunity) and blood (a measurable compartment). Granuloma formation and function is captured by a spatio-temporal model (i.e., ABM), while LN and blood compartments represent temporal dynamics of the whole body in response to infection and are captured with ordinary differential equations (ODEs). In order to have a more mechanistic representation of APC trafficking from the lung to the lymph node, and to better capture antigen presentation in a draining LN, this current study incorporates the role of dendritic cells (DCs) in a computational fashion into GranSim. RESULTS: The model was calibrated using experimental data from the lungs and blood of NHPs. The addition of DCs allowed us to investigate in greater detail mechanisms of recruitment, trafficking and antigen presentation and their role in tuberculosis infection. CONCLUSION: The main conclusion of this study is that early events after Mtb infection are critical to establishing a timely and effective response. Manipulating CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation rates, as well as DC migration early on during infection can determine the difference between bacterial clearance vs. uncontrolled bacterial growth and dissemination.},

abstract = {Up to now, the effects of having heterogeneous networks of contacts have been studied mostly for diseases which are not persistent in time, i.e., for diseases where the infectious period can be considered very small compared to the lifetime of an individual. Moreover, all these previous results have been obtained for closed populations, where the number of individuals does not change during the whole duration of the epidemics. Here, we go one step further and analyze, both analytically and numerically, a radically different kind of diseases: those that are persistent and can last for an individual's lifetime. To be more specific, we particularize to the case of tuberculosis' (TB) infection dynamics, where the infection remains latent for a period of time before showing up and spreading to other individuals. We introduce an epidemiological model for TB-like persistent infections taking into account the heterogeneity inherent to the population structure. This sort of dynamics introduces new analytical and numerical challenges that we are able to sort out. Our results show that also for persistent diseases the epidemic threshold depends on the ratio of the first two moments of the degree distribution so that it goes to zero in a class of scale-free networks when the system approaches the thermodynamic limit.},

Antimicrobial use in food animals subjects their enteric commensals to antimicrobial pressure. A fraction of enteric Escherichia coli in cattle exhibit plasmid-gene mediated AMR to a third-generation cephalosporin ceftiofur. We adapted stochastic differential equations with diffusion approximation (a compartmental stochastic mathematical model) to research the sources and roles of stochasticity in the resistance dynamics, both during parenteral antimicrobial therapy and in its absence. The results demonstrated that demographic stochasticity among enteric E. coli in the occurrence of relevant events was important for the AMR dynamics only when bacterial numbers were depressed during therapy. However, stochasticity in the parameters of enteric E. coli ecology, whether externally or intrinsically driven, contributed to a wider distribution of the resistant E. coli fraction, both during therapy and in its absence, with stochasticities in individual parameters interacting in their contribution.},

abstract = {SETTING: Mycobacterium bovis bacille Calmette-Gueŕin (BCG) is provided to all infants born in Finland. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the cost-effectiveness of universal versus selective BCG immunization. DESIGN: A Markov model was developed to simulate rates of tuberculosis (TB) and non-tuberculous mycobacterial disease (NTM), and to examine the cost-effectiveness in terms of cost per case averted of three different strategies: universal BCG, selective BCG (10{\%} of infants at higher TB risk than other infants) or no BCG immunization. RESULTS: In a cohort of 60,000 infants over 15 years, the model predicts five cases each of TB and NTM disease with universal immunization, 8-21 TB and 31 NTM cases with various strategies of selective immunization, and 25 TB and 34 NTM cases with no BCG immunization. BCG side-effects are predicted in 5, 0.5 and 0 infants, respectively. The cost per case averted for immunization strategies ranges from a cost of 38,311 US dollars to a savings of 323 dollars as selective immunization becomes more efficient at targeting infants at highest risk of TB. CONCLUSIONS: In a country with a low incidence of pediatric tuberculosis, selective BCG immunization is a more cost-effective strategy than universal BCG immunization for the prevention of tuberculosis, but results in an increase in NTM cases.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Bacille Calmette-Gu{\'{e}}rin (BCG) vaccine is given to Canadian Aboriginal neonates in selected communities. Severe reactions and deaths associated with BCG have been reported among infants born with immunodeficiency syndromes. The main objective of this study was to estimate threshold values for severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) incidence, above which BCG is associated with greater risk than benefit. METHODS: A Markov model was developed to simulate the natural histories of tuberculosis (TB) and SCID in children from birth to 14 years. The annual risk of tuberculous infection (ARI) and SCID incidence were varied in analyses. The model compared a scenario of no vaccination to intervention with BCG. Appropriate variability and uncertainty analyses were conducted. Outcomes included TB incidence and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). RESULTS: In sensitivity analyses, QALYs were lower among vaccinated infants if the ARI was 0.1{\%} and the rate of SCID was higher than 4.2 per 100,000. Assuming an ARI of 1{\%}, this threshold increased to 41 per 100,000. In uncertainty analyses (Monte Carlo simulations) which assumed an ARI of 0.1{\%}, QALYs were not significantly increased by BCG unless SCID incidence is 0. With this ARI, QALYs were significantly decreased among vaccinated children if SCID incidence exceeds 23 per 100,000. BCG is associated with a significant increase in QALYs if the ARI is 1{\%}, and SCID incidence is below 5 per 100,000. CONCLUSION: The possibility that Canadian Aboriginal children are at increased risk for SCID has serious implications for continued BCG use in this population. In this context, enhanced TB Control--including early detection and treatment of infection--may be a safer, more effective alternative.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Population models of tuberculosis transmission have not accounted for social contact structure and the role of the environment in which tuberculosis is transmitted. METHODS: We utilized extensions to the Wells-Riley model of tuberculosis transmission, using exhaled carbon dioxide as a tracer gas, to describe transmission patterns in an endemic community. Drawing upon social interaction data and carbon dioxide measurements from a South African township, we created an age-structured model of tuberculosis transmission in households, public transit, schools, and workplaces. We fit the model to local data on latent tuberculosis prevalence by age. RESULTS: Most tuberculosis infections (84{\%}) were estimated to occur outside of one's own household. Fifty percent of infections among young adults (ages 15-19) occurred in schools, due to high contact rates and poor ventilation. Despite lower numbers of contacts in workplaces, assortative mixing among adults with high rates of smear-positive tuberculosis contributed to transmission in this environment. Households and public transit were important sites of transmission between age groups. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with molecular epidemiologic estimates, a minority of tuberculosis transmission was estimated to occur within households, which may limit the impact of contact investigations. Further work is needed to investigate the role of schools in tuberculosis transmission.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) is a threat to TB control. To guide TB control, it is essential to understand the extent to which and the circumstances in which MDR-TB will replace drug-susceptible TB (DS-TB) as the dominant phenotype. We examined the issue by presenting evidence from genomics, pharmacokinetics and epidemiology studies. We then synthesised this evidence into a mathematical model. METHODS Our model consider two TB strains, one with and one without MDR phenotype. We allowed that intrinsic transmissibility may be different between the two strains, as may the control response including detection rate, treatment failure and default rates. We explored the outcomes in terms of incidence of MDR-TB and time until MDR-TB surpasses DS-TB as the dominant strain. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The ability of MDR-TB to dominate DS-TB was highly sensitive to the relative transmissibility of the resistant strain; however, MDR-TB could dominate even when its transmissibility was modestly reduced (to between 50{\%} and 100{\%} as transmissible as DS-TB strain). Our model suggest that it may take decades or more for strain replacement to occur. We also found that while amplification of resistance is the early cause of MDR-TB, this will rapidly give way to person-to-person transmission.},

The degree of clustering of isolates on the basis of genotypes is informative of the extent of transmission in a given geographic area. We analyzed 130 published data sets of M. tuberculosis isolates, each representing a sample of bacterial isolates from a specific geographic region, typed with either or both of the IS6110-RFLP and spoligotyping methods. We explored common features and differences among these samples. Using population models, we found that the presence of large clusters (typically associated with recent transmission) as well as a large number of singletons (genotypes found exactly once in the data set) is consistent with an expanding infectious population. We also estimated the mutation rate of spoligotype patterns relative to IS6110 patterns and found the former rate to be about 10-26{\%} of the latter. This study illustrates the utility of examining the full distribution of genotype cluster sizes from a given region, in the light of population genetic models.},

Health and economic outcomes of isoniazid treatment of 20- and 40-yr-old close contacts were compared in a Markov model over a 20-yr period following screening with TST only (at three cut-off values) and T-SPOT.TB alone or in combination with the TST. T-SPOT.TB-based treatment was cost-effective at (Euro)11,621 and (Euro)23,692 per life-year-gained (LYG) in the younger and older age group, respectively. No TST-based programmes were cost-effective, except at a 15-mm cut-off in the younger group only, where the cost-effectiveness ((Euro)26,451.LYG(-1)) fell just below the willingness-to-pay threshold. Combination of the TST with T-SPOT.TB slightly reduced the total cost compared with the T-SPOT.TB alone by 4.4 and 5.0{\%} in the younger and older groups respectively. The number of contacts treated to avoid one case of TB decreased from 50 (95{\%} confidence interval 32-106) with the TST (10-mm cut-off) to 18 (95{\%}CI 11-43) if T-SPOT.TB was used. Using T-SPOT.TB alone or in combination with the tuberculin skin test for screening of close contacts before latent tuberculosis infection treatment is highly cost-effective in reducing the disease burden of tuberculosis.},

abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, predominantly affecting low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where resources are limited. As such, countries need to be able to choose the most efficient interventions for their respective setting. Mathematical models can be valuable tools to inform rational policy decisions and improve resource allocation, but are often unavailable or inaccessible for LMICs, particularly in TB. We developed TIME Impact, a user-friendly TB model that enables local capacity building and strengthens country-specific policy discussions to inform support funding applications at the (sub-)national level (e.g. Ministry of Finance) or to international donors (e.g. the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria).TIME Impact is an epidemiological transmission model nested in TIME, a set of TB modelling tools available for free download within the widely-used Spectrum software. The TIME Impact model reflects key aspects of the natural history of TB, with additional structure for HIV/ART, drug resistance, treatment history and age. TIME Impact enables national TB programmes (NTPs) and other TB policymakers to better understand their own TB epidemic, plan their response, apply for funding and evaluate the implementation of the response.The explicit aim of TIME Impact's user-friendly interface is to enable training of local and international TB experts towards independent use. During application of TIME Impact, close involvement of the NTPs and other local partners also builds critical understanding of the modelling methods, assumptions and limitations inherent to modelling. This is essential to generate broad country-level ownership of the modelling data inputs and results. In turn, it stimulates discussions and a review of the current evidence and assumptions, strengthening the decision-making process in general.TIME Impact has been effectively applied in a variety of settings. In South Africa, it informed the first South African HIV and TB Investment Cases and successfully leveraged additional resources from the National Treasury at a time of austerity. In Ghana, a long-term TIME model-centred interaction with the NTP provided new insights into the local epidemiology and guided resource allocation decisions to improve impact.},

Direct healthcare costs prior to confirmation of TB or nontuberculous mycobacteria by PCR or culture were included. Effectiveness was measured by the probability of correct treatment and isolation decisions. In the baseline situation NOPCR costs Euro 29.50 less than the +PCR strategy per patient tested. According to sensitivity analyses, reducing PCR test price, shortening test performance time or increasing the proportion of smear-positive patients in the tested population would contribute to cost savings with the +PCR strategy. Routine polymerase chain reaction testing of all specimens from suspected tuberculosis patients in a low-prevalence population was not cost-saving. When the polymerase chain reaction assay was applied only to smear-positive sputum specimens, the smear and culture strategy was clearly dominated by it, i.e. the polymerase chain reaction smear-positive sputum strategy was less costly and more effective in producing correct treatment decisions and isolations.},

abstract = {SETTING: A major out-patient tuberculosis clinic in Nairobi, Kenya. OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the cost-effectiveness of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the diagnosis of tuberculosis in an urban setting in a developing country. DESIGN: A cost-effectiveness analysis of PCR and direct smear microscopy examination based on theoretical modelling. The cost-effectiveness was expressed in costs per correctly diagnosed tuberculosis patient for each of the two diagnostic techniques. Data were obtained from the literature, from the staff and the register at the health facility and from structured interviews with patients. Assumptions were made when no data were available. RESULTS: The PCR is expected to be more specific and sensitive than the routine procedure for diagnosis, but it is also more costly. The routine procedure based on direct smear microscopy turned out to be 1.8 times as cost-effective as PCR. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that the PCR method can potentially be a cost-effective screening procedure for tuberculosis, provided that the largest contributing cost component, the costs of the PCR-kit, can be reduced substantially.},

The dynamics is formulated through a compartmental system of non-linear ordinary differential equations. The stability of the trivial equilibrium point or absence of infections and the endemic basins are analyzed based on the threshold values for the HIV and MTB transmission coefficients. In order to deal with the estimation of the transmission coefficients of HIV and MTB infections we consider the incarcerated individuals in the Female Penitentiary of S?o Paulo State, Brazil.},
