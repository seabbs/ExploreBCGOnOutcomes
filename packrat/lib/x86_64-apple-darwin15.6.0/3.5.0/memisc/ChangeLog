    into factors with sorted unique values (after recoding) as levels.

  - 'getSummary.glm' now takes care of missing values in weights of glm objects.

2014-08-19:

    - for exponentiated coefficients in glm-models,
                             contributed by Dave Atkins.
  - Made the 'spss.fixed.file' importer function more robust:
      - It works now, even if 'varlab.file', 'codes.file',

      - It now handles value labels of character string variables correctly.

2013-01-04:

2012-02-14:

  - Removed mkHelpDir() that has not worked for a while because of architectural
    changes in R.
  - Removed some unused variables from the C-code that caused warnings.

    to mtable output for various categorical models.

  - Fixed problems with SPSS system files that do not contain an 'info_flt64' record. This problem led to zeroes in the data section of the file being erroneously interpreted as *sysmis*.
  - Fixed 'show' and 'print' methods for 'data.set' objects - they no do fit the width set by options(width=...), without ugly line breaks.
  - Changed the default value of the 'compress.storage.modes' option for the
    subset and bracket methods o 'importer' objects to FALSE, which is much
    more safer.

2010-07-16:
  - fixed a bug in 'Simulate' that caused it to fail in certain situations
    in R version >= 2.11.

2010-04-12:
  - 'toLatex(mtable(<something>),useDcolumn=FALSE)' should now produce useable
    LaTeX output ($'s are added to the table entries).

2010-04-09:
  - 'By' works now with 'genTable' and 'aggregate.formula'. It gains a 'data.frame'
    method, which better cooperates with calls to 'lm'-like functions. Their results
    get a 'data' component containing the subset of the data frame that was given
    as 'data' argument to the call of 'By'.

2010-04-08:
  - fixed bug in 'cases'. It works now with target expressions even with 'within'.
  - 'write.mtable' now handles a 'forLaTeX=TRUE' option in a more convenient way.
  - 'mtable' now handles objects of classes "polr" and "simex", thanks to a contribution
    from Christopher N. Lawrence (Texas A&M International University)
  - support for 'mtable' output for "glm" objects with exponentiated coefficients
    and prelininary support for "lmer" object added, thanks to a contribution from
    Dave Atkins (Unversity of Washington). Also the coef.styles are changed to be
    more convenient.

2010-04-07:
  - fixed bug in C-level function 'read_sysfile_subset' that caused spurious errors
    while importing SPSS 'system' files with long strings.

2010-03-18:
  - patch to trimws to make it locale-neutral

2010-03-11:
  - fixed bugs in mtable and format.mtable. Short 'summary.stats'
    arguments or 'summary.stats=FALSE' should work now.

2010-03-06:
  - fixed bug in genTable/percentage: total counts disappeared if
    a factor level had the same name as the name given to the total count
  - changed the default value of the 'digits' option of the matrix method
    of the toLatex generic to the more sensible getOption("digits")
  - the matrix method of the toLatex generic gains new optional arguments
    'show.vars', 'show.xvar', and 'show.yvar', which determine whether
    the name of the row and/or the column variable should be shown if
    the matrix is a 2-dimensional table.

2010-03-02:
  - fixed minor bug in 'cases' function

2009-11-11:
  - correction bug in .unLoad function.

2009-10-14:
  - removed 'extended' arguments from calls to 'regexpr' and 'sub' etc. (for compatibility
    with R 2.11)

2009-08-19:
  - corrected documentation for mtable (\usepackage instead of usepackage)
  - completed documentation for contrasts generic
  - fixed bug in the internals for 'spss.portable.file':
    'SPSS Por' to ascii and 'SPSS Por' to integer translation tables
    were one item too short.

2009-06-02:
  - as.factor methods for item vectors adapted to new factor function
    in R 2.10.0
  - Fixed bug in sample.data.frame and sample.data.set methods:
    Samples were drawn only from the first m observations, where m is
    the number of variables in the data frame/data set.
