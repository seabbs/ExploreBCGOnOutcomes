Rcgmin                  An R implementation of a nonlinear conjugate
                        gradient algorithm with the Dai / Yuan update
                        and restart. Based on Nash (1979) Algorithm 22
                        for its main structure.
Rcgminb                 An R implementation of a bounded nonlinear
