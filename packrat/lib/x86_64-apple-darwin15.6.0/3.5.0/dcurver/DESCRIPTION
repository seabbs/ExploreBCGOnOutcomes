Title: Utility Functions for Davidian Curves
Author: Oğuzhan Öğreden
Maintainer: Oğuzhan Öğreden <oguzhan@oguzhanogreden.com>
Description: A Davidian curve defines a seminonparametric density, whose shape and flexibility can be tuned by
  easy to estimate parameters. Since a special case of a Davidian curve is the standard normal density,
  Davidian curves can be used for relaxing normality assumption in statistical applications (Zhang & Davidian, 2001)
  <doi:10.1111/j.0006-341X.2001.00795.x>. This package provides the density function, the gradient of
  the loglikelihood and a random generator for Davidian curves.
